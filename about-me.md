I use this blog mostly for longer pieces than what fits in other outlets like [Twitter](http://twitter.com/davidascher) or [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/102909852059964718269/).

Professionally, I write mostly about things Mozilla: the web, innovation (and how to facilitate it), email, javascript & python, technology & society&#8230;

The more personal things that show up here likely have to do with where I live (Vancouver, BC), where I&#8217;ve lived (Paris, England, US), or what I eat & drink (pretty much everything).

If you want to reach me by email, my professional email is firstInitialLastInitial at mozilla dot com.Â  My personal email is first name at lastname.ca.
