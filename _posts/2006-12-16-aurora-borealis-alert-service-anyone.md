Poking around flickr&#8217;s hot tags, I noticed that &#8220;auroraborealis&#8221; and &#8220;northernlights&#8221; were hot tags in the last 24hrs. It looks from the pictures corresponding to those tags are from Alaska, which is nice for them. I&#8217;m frustrated that I&#8217;ve been &#8220;north&#8221; for six years and have yet to see them. I could setup a feed on flickr pictures tagged &#8220;vancouver&#8221; and &#8220;auroraborealis&#8221;, but I suspect that will cheerfully let me know about them a day too late. Isn&#8217;t there&#8217;s a way to get notified when the northern lights are happening (I&#8217;d be happy to be woken up!)?
