Dear LazyWeb,

I use MarsEdit to author my blog posts, then publish to WordPress 2.2, and see some of my posts aggregated by some Planet sites.

Every now and then I need to make a minor change, and that seems to result in resyndication so that readers of the planet feed get duplicates.

Is there a trick in either MarsEdit or WordPress to identifying minor updates?
