[Paul Kedrosky](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/001170.html) self-flagellates himself (which seems a bit of a redundant phrase, but without the &#8220;himself&#8221; it seems awkward &#8212; &#8220;bancal&#8221; in French) on his too-frequent use of the word &#8220;interesting&#8221;.

I like to use the word &#8220;instering&#8221; instead, and plan on doing so until my kids stop saying it. It&#8217;s so much more instering than interesting.

PyCon, for one was quite instering. I&#8217;ll have to gather some thoughts on it and ETech for public consumption at some point.
