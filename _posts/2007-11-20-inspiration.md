As soon as possible I&#8217;d like to post something like [this post by Mark Hamburg](http://blogs.adobe.com/lightroomjournal/2007/09/lightrooms_goals_1.html), about Adobe Lightroom&#8217;s goals. My challenge of course is that I&#8217;ll have to make those goals public before shipping, not after, and I&#8217;ll have to work out what those goals should be in a transparent global room with thousands of interested onlookers.

I wonder how many of Lightroom&#8217;s goals as stated by Mark should be Lightroom specific, and how many are true of any piece of software.
