I just got a [Trumba](http://www.trumba.com) beta account (along w/ 12 million others, I&#8217;m sure). Trumba is a new online calendaring service, similar to Yahoo! Calendar and twelve gazillion others.

So far, I&#8217;m quite pleased. The UI is nice, the basic concepts seem nice. I don&#8217;t know anyone else&#8217;s account, so I haven&#8217;t tried &#8220;sharing&#8221; calendars, but I have started to [publish a sub-calendar](http://www.trumba.com/calendars/davidascher).

Nits, which would help convince me fully:

  * Not clear how to have a public calendar show an event on a parent calendar as busy but w/o details.
  * I want to be able to quickly enter an event w/o having to tab all the way down to the bottom of the new event form. Ctrl+S or such.
  * I want to be able to really, really, _really_ easily turn an email into a private event with attached note. Possible ways to do so include: a Thunderbird plugin, an email-to-event interface, or a flickr/uploader style drag & drop target.
  * I need integration of my contact list. Entering lists of email addresses doesn&#8217;t really cut it. Gmail is a good model to look at there (or suck data from). 

Other buglets:

  * The color choices for the weekly view are weird &#8212; including a very bright yellow. 
  * The date &#8220;Goto&#8221; field doesn&#8217;t do anything interesting when you put in &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; or &#8220;today&#8221;, but it doesn&#8217;t complain either. 
  * Some days are colored darkish green in my summary calendar view, and I have no idea why. Oops, that&#8217;s gone. Very strange. 

Feature Wishlist:

  * I have a big screen, so I&#8217;d like to be able to have the features of the 1-day or 3-day view applied to a full week or a 5-day week. 
  * I want to be able to type in &#8220;August&#8221; in the Go To field and have it do that. 
  * I think I want event categories, with implied defaults. Meetings have 10-minute reminders, birthdays have 3-day reminders, etc. 
  * My public calendar should have a name which doesn&#8217;t necessarily include a prefix derived from my main calendar. The URL doesn&#8217;t have to, which is good. 

Random other bits:

  * By default, published calendars have Google AdWords. That&#8217;s odd, as I have no idea who would get the money, or how Google would figure out what adwords to use to pick ads. I turned mine off.
  * Generally very nice use of DHTML/Ajax. Things work the way you hope they will (e.g. click on a calendar day in the &#8220;new event&#8221; view and it updates the form appropriately.
  * Generally good word choices

So far there&#8217;s an &#8220;invite a friend&#8221; button, but it doesn&#8217;t let me do that yet. Just sign up for the beta is my advice. I did so a few weeks ago IIRC.

Overall, it&#8217;s an interesting bit of technology, in desperate need for integration with others of its kin. I&#8217;ll be interested to see the business model details be unwrapped over the next few weeks.

Note to the world: Thunderbird is a pretty decent piece of software by now which has been underserved by extension authors. It needs Greasemonkey-style attention, and it could do a lot to solve the current PIM/groupware nightmare.
