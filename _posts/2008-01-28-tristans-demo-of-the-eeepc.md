Tristan Nitot has a [cute video](http://standblog.org/blog/post/2008/01/28/Essai-de-leeePC-dAsus) of a few first experiences with the [eeePC](http://eeepc.asus.com/global/product.htm) from ASUS, the very small, solid state memory, under a kilo. Comes with Firefox and Thunderbird built-in, of course. An interesting device.
