Just played two games of werewolf (well, three, but i was killed early in the first one, so it doesn&#8217;t count). I need to play games like that more often, it&#8217;s quite a lot of fun. Conferences are a good place for games full of deception and mindgames &#8212; you don&#8217;t really know people well enough to confuse the personal relationship with the game persona, but you get to know them in unorthodox ways through game interactions.
