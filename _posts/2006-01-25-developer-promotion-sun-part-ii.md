_Yesterday_, I [blogged](http://ascher.ca/blog/2006/01/24/grr-sun-microsystems-and-customer-self-service-or-lack-thereof/) about my frustration with the almost-perfect-and-then-bad experience with Sun&#8217;s partner program.

Today, I got an email from Sun&#8217;s Director of Web Experience Design (whose name I won&#8217;t mention because I don&#8217;t know if he minds being mentioned on the public web), telling me it&#8217;s not normal practice, and that he&#8217;d like the original email so he can figure out what happened.

That&#8217;s cool in many ways.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know how the story will end and whether we&#8217;ll end up spending more $&#8217;s on Sun, but at the very least they are on the [cluetrain](http://cluetrain.com/).&nbsp; Kudos to Sun and whoever noticed my blog and forwarded on internally (I have a suspect in mind, but it doesn&#8217;t matter who it is, only that the culture inside &#8220;works&#8221;).
