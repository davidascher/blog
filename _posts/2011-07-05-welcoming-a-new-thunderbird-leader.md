Last week, we released the latest version of [Thunderbird](http://mozilla.org/thunderbird)! This release marks the first of our releases from within our new [combined team which I mentioned in the past](http://blog.ascher.ca/2011/04/04/the-future-of-messaging/). Get it & enjoy it &#8212; I&#8217;ll draw your eye in particular to the new integrated add-on manager and my personal can&#8217;t-live-without add-on, the [Conversations add-on](https://mozillalabs.com/messaging/thunderbird-conversations/) which has matured a lot since I last mentioned it.

This month also marks the introduction of a critical new addition to the Thunderbird team: I introduced _JB Piacentino_ to the Mozilla weekly call and Thunderbird teams a couple of weeks ago, but this seems like a fine time to introduce him to the broader community. JB is now the new Managing Director for Thunderbird. I&#8217;m confident that he&#8217;s going to provide what Thunderbird has been needing for a while now &#8212; someone who can have a broad enough perspective on Thunderbird to understand its breadth and full potential impact, but with a focused enough mandate that Thunderbird will get the attention it deserves.

JB has an ideal background to complement the rest of the Thunderbird team&#8217;s skills &#8212; in particular, he has a combination of entrepreneurial expertise and a passion for product marketing which will serve Thunderbird well. And while he&#8217;s new to the Mozilla community, he&#8217;s been an avid follower and supporter of Mozilla for a long time.

I&#8217;m also excited about the fact that JB is based in Paris, France. Thunderbird has a significant concentration of users in Europe, and moving the center of gravity of the project closer to our users will likely have a broad set of benefits.

I&#8217;m visiting JB and the Mozilla Paris office this week in fact, and we&#8217;d like to welcome anyone who happens to be in the area to come to a Q&A we&#8217;ll be having at the Mozilla office tomorrow evening:

> 28 Boulevard PoissonniÃ¨re  
> 75009 Paris  
> at 7pm (19:00)

I encourage people to [get in touch with JB](mailto:jb@mozilla.com), and share your thoughts about Thunderbird.
