I&#8217;m at ETech 2007 in San Diego.

Notables:

Twitter-mania is [everywhere](http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2007/03/26/this_twitter_th.html). PaulK on what twitter has on blogging: &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to be inane, at least be inane concisely&#8221;. And someone on IRC: &#8220;Twitter: teaching America about SMS&#8221;.

Fun is in. This is a good thing, except that creating fun is turning into a [process](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shufflebrain.com%2Fetech06.htm&ei=8cMIRoq-CYW6gAOFxoXoBg&usg=__7yxWhSzHjic0DDlEL8sRd3nEeMM=&sig2=FtO6kou4ilnZWD81A10l8A) with all of the serendipity and creativity of adsense optimization.

I&#8217;m noticing lots of ads in magazines about wealth management. And homeless people wandering the halls of luxury hotels.

Dean Edwards launches yet [another JS library](http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2007/03/yet-another/) and [rules about JS libraries](http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2007/03/rules/) which everyone seems to break with great success.

I&#8217;m having fun writing JavaScript. No, really.

The best value for your dollar in accomodations in San Diego is the Downtown Hostel. Reminds me of college coops, in a good way. Biggest problem so far was the earnest young turk this morning who was over-eager to make my pancakes (he&#8217;d learned yesterday). You don&#8217;t teach _me_ how to make pancakes. (his attempt came out stuck to the pan, mine were gorgeous).
