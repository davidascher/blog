I realized that I forgot to cross-post here when I [posted on Medium](http://medium.com/david-ascher/next-chapter-2678e262ce27), so in case you didn&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve left Mozilla and am exploring possible future scenarios.

Thinking it&#8217;s probably a good idea to verbalize as I go, as I&#8217;m finding conversations to be the best part of my job, and this might provoke some.

Raw Ingredients

  * Lightweight infrastructures, from AWS Lambda and the like to the remarkably fun startup projects emerging on that space, esp. Zeit.co&#8217;s [Now](https://zeit.co/now) , Polybit&#8217;s [Stdlib](https://stdlib.com/), Auth0&#8217;s [Webtask](https://webtask.io/) (and what&#8217;s coming but still missing)
  * The rapidly evolving Javascript landscape, and other languages from [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) to [Eve](https://witheve.com) (and old favorites like [Metapost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaPost))
  * Learning about the role that software systems are playing in environment-impacting technologies, from smart grids and energy storage to transportation (and avoiding transportation)
  * Reading and hearing about more humane organizational models than traditional VC-funded C-corps, from B-corps to cooperatives.

Directions

  * Anything that might help bend the temperature curve
  * Projects that heal or help create healthy communities
  * Projects that combine entrepreneurial approaches, modern technology, and public benefit, whether that&#8217;s via research, better government, or just useful products.
  * Problems that are tough because they&#8217;re multidisciplinary
