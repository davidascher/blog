I&#8217;m very happy about this bit of news which was made public today: Damien Katz was just [hired](http://damienkatz.net/2008/01/new_gig.html) by IBM to work on CouchDB, and CouchDB will be donated to the Apache Software Foundation. This is very cool stuff, and this new job means that it will move faster, not slower. CouchDB is a project worth watching.
