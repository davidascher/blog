A few things have happened that I keep meaning to talk about, but never find the time.

Tomorrow at 9:30am PST (1730 UTC) is the first weekly [status call](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird/StatusMeetings/2008-03-04) for Thunderbird (well, first that I know of). It&#8217;ll be chaotic and unstructured I&#8217;m sure, but we&#8217;ll figure it out over the next few weeks. One of the big topics for discussion will be how to structure the work towards our first alpha of 3.0, which won&#8217;t be feature complete by any means, but should be a good first step towards releasing a stable Thunderbird build off of the current 1.9 trunk of Gecko. Crawl, walk, run.

Today, Emre and I started the move into the new Vancouver offices of Mozilla Messaging, at 675 West Hastings (the old RBC building, for the locals). Possible karmic connection: just yesterday, the impressive boring machine [made it through](http://flickr.com/photos/al-in-blue/2309452924/) to the Waterfront station across the street. I look forward to that giant hole in the ground being filled again! I was a bit sad to leave my friends at ActiveState where I&#8217;d been staying, but this way I get to make new friends at [Actenum](http://www.actenum.com/index.php).

Also worth noting is [this post](http://blog.mozilla.com/gen/2008/03/04/ntt-docomo-isp-mopera-u-promotes-thunderbird/) by Gen Kanai about recent Thunderbird activity in Japan. It&#8217;s interesting that the Mopera extension he talks about is exactly what we&#8217;re talking about in the newsgroups this week.
