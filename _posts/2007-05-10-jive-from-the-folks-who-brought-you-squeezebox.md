My old friend Dean Blackketter just told me about [Jive](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.cgi?JiveArchitecture), which looks like it&#8217;s an architecture for building internet-enabled software that will be able to run on devices like the Squeezebox, and, presumably, future hardware from Logitech, the new owners of Slim Devices, the makers of said Squeezebox, hence employers of said friend.

The technology stack in that [architecture document](http://wiki.slimdevices.com/index.cgi?JiveArchitecture) is fascinating. Loads of open source, proven technology. Scalable graphics via freetype, jpeg/png and SDL. Scripting via Lua. Networking via HTTP, Comet, etc.

A space worth watching.
