A few more rough job descriptions, which I&#8217;ll polish soon, but may as well start getting resumes now:

First, we&#8217;re looking for a _jack-of-all-trades web developer_. We have a fair number of websites and webapps, and depend on/want to contribute to a bunch more. It&#8217;s time we had someone on staff to help us power through those changes. The ideal candidate will have experience with at least PHP and Python-based webapps on Unix/Linux, comfortable with the usual Apache, MySQL, stack (preferably with some HA scars), and be happy to help do some JS/CSS/HTML client-side work as well. The job will include a blend of new web development, maintenance of existing sites, and patches to project-wide apps. Past experience working in open source, distributed, transparent projects is a huge plus. If not located in Vancouver, experience working remotely will be required.

Second, we&#8217;re looking for some contractors to help us work on Thunderbird add-ons. A strong JavaScript application developer with good CSS/HTML skills is a minimal requirement, past experience writing add-ons for Gecko-based apps a definite plus. You&#8217;ll be working with the Vancouver-based design team and the broader distributed developer community to quickly iterate on add-ons that enhance the Thunderbird user experience. Being located near Vancouver, BC, would be great, but we would consider remote candidates in nearby timezones.
