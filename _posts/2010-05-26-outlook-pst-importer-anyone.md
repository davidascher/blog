This week, Microsoft published an open source (Apache 2) [SDK to read PST files](http://pstsdk.codeplex.com/). From what I heard, it works with Unicode PST files as generated by Outlook 2003 or later.

It&#8217;s a healthy move on Microsoft&#8217;s part, as it releases their users from feeling like their data is locked in to their relationship with Outlook. I hope the code is easy to use, etc.

I&#8217;d naturally be very interested to hear of anyone experimenting with using this code in an add-on to make the process of importing all one&#8217;s data from Outlook into Thunderbird. If you know of such an effort, let me know!
