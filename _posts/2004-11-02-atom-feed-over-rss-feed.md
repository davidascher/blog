I just (duh!) figured out one benefit of Atom feeds over older RSS feeds &#8212; the body of the posts are more than just CDATA, but can include links and other markup. Now, I&#8217;d like a [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com) feature that &#8220;auto-upgraded&#8221; all of my old feeds to Atom feeds if there are some to be found &#8220;near&#8221; my existing feeds.
