I am trying to convince a friend of mine with an interest in writing (stories, more or less based on personal experience) that she should publish through the web. She&#8217;d be doing it as a creative outlet, not with a particular financial or &#8220;book&#8221; goal in mind, so the standard &#8220;publishers won&#8217;t touch web-published content&#8221; worries aren&#8217;t really relevant. My feeling is that much of what drives the blogosphere should (and probably does) apply to less diary-style writing as well.

I wanted to send her some pointers to examples that would show the breadth of what &#8220;people are doing&#8221; on the net, but I quickly realized that much of what _I_ read is either too &#8216;non-fiction&#8217; (whether technical or legal or political or&#8230;) or too &#8216;big media&#8217; (e.g. [Salon](http://www.salon.com)), and much of the more &#8216;individual&#8217; content I run across just isn&#8217;t very good or very inspiring. I do enjoy sites like [Ftrain](http://www.ftrain.com) (if for no other reason than I enjoy Paul&#8217;s design sense), but I&#8217;m seeking other samples that span a larger literary spectrum. (Someone tell me if <a>technorati</a> or some other site can help do this&#8212;I&#8217;m not having much luck with automated searches).

So, I&#8217;m asking the readers of this blog if they have suggestions that I can pass onto my friend&#8212;fictional pieces, biographical pieces, poetry, whatever. Preferably sites where the author has figured a way to engage the readership in discussions about the work. Email me or add a comment. Thanks!
