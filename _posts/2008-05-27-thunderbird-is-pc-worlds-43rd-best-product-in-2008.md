PC World’ s editors have selected Mozilla Thunderbird as one of “[The 100 Best Products of 2008 Award](http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,146161-page,12-c,electronics/article.html)” winners, specifically in the 43rd position, in between the Rock Band controllers and the Dell XPS 420 (???).

That&#8217;s a weird and fascinating list. I&#8217;m not a huge fan of this kind of list in general. However, regardless of the specific merits of any of these rankings, it can&#8217;t be a bad thing to be listed there! We should get them to update their review though, which dates back quite a while!

I can&#8217;t wait to see where we land in 2009&#8230;
