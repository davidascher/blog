It is _so_ refreshing to see an executive [speak out](http://www.adambosworth.net/archives/000047.html), and speak out in favor of my core beliefs. (The post is old, but I just found it):

> It is time to speak up. It is time to say that facts are what matter, not faith, that human progress is accomplished through unfettered use of reason and inquiry and tolerance and discussion and debate, not through intolerant and irrational acts of terror or edicts. For all of our children and for the future, speak up against this wave of intolerance and irrationalism washing over the world.

Adam Bosworth rules.

Found via [Ross Mayfield&#8217;s blog](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/10/speaking_up.html).

Also nice to see is Tim O&#8217;Reilly [speaking out](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/10/it_seems_to_be_working_for_jes.html) on the also important if maybe less traumatizing issues around copyright:

> Google&#8217;s opt out approach is the only way to cut the Gordian knot of forgotten rights and permissions.
