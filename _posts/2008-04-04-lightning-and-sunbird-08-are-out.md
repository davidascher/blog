[This release](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/calendar/2008/04/lightning_08_and_sunbird_08_ar.html) has a lot of changes &#8211; my favorite new feature is the task mode, which I&#8217;d been waiting for for a long time.

Make sure you read the [release notes](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/releases/lightning0.8.html), as there are a couple of important points to follow.

Congratulations to the Calendar team!
