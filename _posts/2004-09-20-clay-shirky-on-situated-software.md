In his latest [essay](http://www.shirky.com/writings/situated_software.html), Clay Shirky makes great points:

  * Scalabily is rarely necessary
  * Community interactions should be part of good designs
  * Software doesn&apos;t need to be built for &#8220;everyone&#8221; or &#8220;forever&#8221; &#8212; sometimes writing software for your mom for six months is just what&apos;s needed.

Recommended.
