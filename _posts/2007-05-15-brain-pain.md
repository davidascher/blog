Research phase at work. Here are some of the things I&#8217;m looking at:

  * As mentioned before, [Flapjax](http://www.flapjax-lang.org/). (I finally got drag and drop to work!), 
  * [Subtext](http://subtextual.org/), from Jonathan Edwards, whom I remember from a cool presentation at OOPSLA a few years back IIRC, 
  * [Tangible programming](http://conal.net/papers/Eros/) 
  * [Live programming](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/2149) 
  * [Links](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/) &#8220;tierless&#8221; programming system 
  * [Logical spreadsheets](http://logic.stanford.edu/spreadsheet/) out of Stanford 

The above also point back to old favorites, such as:

  * [Alice](http://www.alice.org/), mentioned in [Jonathan Edward&#8217;s blog](http://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=44#more-44) 
  * and everyone on Digg is agog about [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/), which has been my inspiration for months now. 

It&#8217;s well trodden territory, and yet it feels as though it hasn&#8217;t been solved yet&#8230;

I need to write up some analysis of Flapjax, Scratch, and Subtext. They all make great contributions (no doubt, based on decades of prior work that I&#8217;m not aware of).

Common theme: functional languages. Haskell, Scheme, OCaml in the backend.
