So it&#8217;s finally live! I&#8217;m talking about the [Google Summer of Code](http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html), a program whereby Google spends $$&#8217;s _via_ open source foundations (such as our own [Python Software Foundation](http://www.python.org/psf)) to students in exchange for code. I&#8217;m happy to see this project actually happen, and I hope it&#8217;s successful for all involved. I heard about it a while back when Chris DiBona was trying to figure out whether foundations would be willing partipants.

The _real_ [Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com), over the next few weeks, will be to come up with:

  * a compelling list of projects (I&#8217;ve started [a draft](http://wiki.python.org/moin/CodingProjectIdeas) on the Python wiki)
  * to rouse interested and interesting students (unfortunately, many of the best probably already have incompatible plans for the summer),
  * to <strike>rope in</strike> recruit mentors who&#8217;ll be able to help the students along if they get stuck.

Still, it&#8217;s a great opportunity to broaden the pool of actors in the open source world to include on a full-time basis those who need to pay the rent. I&#8217;m confident that the open source communities around each of these foundations step up to the plate, and we&#8217;ll end up in the fall with some code, sure, but more importantly some fresh blood with energy and a few scars to go with the experience gained.
