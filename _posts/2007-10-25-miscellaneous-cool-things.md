  * The Mozilla Calendar project released version 0.7 of [Sunbird](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/) and [Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/download.html). Sunbird is a standalone calendar app kinda like Apple&#8217;s iCal, and Lightning is the same functionality as an extension for Thunderbird. This version is miles ahead of where the last (0.5) version was. It&#8217;s not finished yet, but it&#8217;s definitely usable, and I&#8217;ve had the privilege of hanging out in IRC channels and phone calls with some of the people involved, and every time I ask about a specific feature or point out an issue, they come back with a bug # and a place on their roadmap. That project is going really well.
    
    I believe that Lightning is going to be fundamentally important for Thunderbird&#8217;s future. There are at least millions, probably tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of people for whom calendaring support in an email client is a _sine qua non_, and by combining the capabilities of Thunderbird today, Lightning 1.0, and some additional special sauce, I think we&#8217;re going to rock.
    
    I&#8217;ll definitely write more about calendaring and collaboration software soon, as I&#8217;ve been learning a lot about calendaring, scheduling, and the like, and I&#8217;d like to encourage others to join the party.
    
    Important note to current users of Lightning 0.5: after an upgrade to 0.7 you may need to re-enable the calendars you want to see. Also, if you want access to Google Calendars, you need the [0.3 build of the &#8220;Google Provider&#8221;](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/4631).

  * The [Mozilla marketing team](http://www.intothefuzz.com/2007/10/24/talking-about-firefox/) has come up with a messaging document for Firefox (that&#8217;s a standard marketing term, by the way), which identifies three major points: _Security_, _Customization_, and my favorite, _100% Organic Software_. I&#8217;m curious to see how the public at large responds to the notion of organic software. I love creative, gutsy marketing like that. I haven&#8217;t thought much about what Thunderbird&#8217;s messaging should look like yet &#8212; we&#8217;ll get to that later.

  * Mozilla Labs launched [Prism](http://labs.mozilla.com/2007/10/prism/), which is the new name for the cool &#8220;take a web app and make a web _app_&#8221; work [Mark Finkle&#8217;s](http://www.starkravingfinkle.org/blog/) been doing. It&#8217;s going to be fascinating to see that evolve. I&#8217;m keen to see if MailCo can push from the desktop &#8220;out&#8221; just like Prism is pushing from the webapp &#8220;in&#8221;. In some ways, that&#8217;s what IMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV, LDAP etc. are all about.
