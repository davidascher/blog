Anyone vaguely interested in the coolest new IDE on the block (Komodo 4, now comes in a [free edition](http://activestate.com/products/komodo_edit/)) should know that there&#8217;s an extensibility challenge on, where the best extensions, macros, hacks, etc. provided by users (you) will win cool prizes, including my favorite, a [Squeezebox](http://slimdevices.com/pi_squeezebox.html) from [Slim Devices](http://slimdevices.com/) (have one, love it). All it takes is a bit of JavaScript, XUL, at most Python, and you can make it dance to your rhythm.

Start with [this post](http://blogs.activestate.com/activestate/2007/03/komodo_extensib_1.html) to find out more. Right now the most punny entry is called [Komode](http://support.activestate.com/forum-topic/komode-modeline-support-f)&#8230;
