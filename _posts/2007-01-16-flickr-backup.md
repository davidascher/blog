As a followup to [my previous post on the topic of Flickr backups](http://ascher.ca/blog/2007/01/05/lazyweb-incremental-flickr-backup-solution-anyone/), I thought I&#8217;d mention that I&#8217;ve been working on such a tool (written in Python) since all of the GUI-based apps I found didn&#8217;t deal well with large numbers of photos, and because it&#8217;s fun anyway. I&#8217;m ironing out some bugs, and then hope to post it in case anyone else is interested.
