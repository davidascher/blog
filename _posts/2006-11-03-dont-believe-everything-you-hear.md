In an email this morning:

> So there&#8217;s this rumour I heard on irc last night that you are moving  to the UK. Is that true?

I love the fact that there are rumors about me (makes me feel so glamorous!), but I wonder where this one&#8217;s coming from. I thought about moving to the UK years ago, but not any time recently.  We&#8217;re happy here.  I&#8217;m currently unhappy that the shower is leaking down into the kitchen, but I think I can handle this particular bump on the road of life&#8230;
