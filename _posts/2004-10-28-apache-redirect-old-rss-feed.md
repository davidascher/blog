In switching to the new blogging software, I have broken the URLs for the old RSS feeds. If anyone has feedback on how I can use Apache .htaccess and the like to redirect a URL that goes through a file that doesn&#8217;t exist (&#8230;/index.cgi/index.rss) over to another URL (&#8230;/blog/wp-rss2.php), please let me know. To those using aggregators to read this site, 1) you probably can&#8217;t see this =), and 2) sorry.

Update: Fixed with some Redirects.
