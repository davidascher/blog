We&#8217;re &#8220;development partners&#8221; of Sun&#8217;s.&nbsp; We just got spam saying that we have access to development machines at &#8220;deep discounts&#8221;.&nbsp; So I go to the website, ask to unearth my password, wait for the email to get to me, login, and get:

> <div class="gwpadding1">
>   <p>
>     Deep discounts on development hardware are available to you! For<br /> additional information please contact your Primary Contact.
>   </p>
> </div>
> 
> <span class="sp10"></span>

I can&#8217;t even begin to list the things that are wrong with this customer interaction.&nbsp; I spent non-trivial time trying to find out how to give Sun $&#8217;s, and end up frustrated at my inability to find out how much and for what. ARGH!
