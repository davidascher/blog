[Bob Villa](http://www.bobvila.com/BVTV/HomeAgain/Video-0116-02-0.html) tours the McMillan Bloedel factory where they make Parallam, a neat glued laminate which super strong, but easier to work with than steel. Uses crappy wood too, which is great. See also [these](http://www.tdsnow.com/tji.htm) neat joists/rafters. I&#8217;m sure the glue will come back to haunt us, but it&#8217;s nice to see that people have come up with engineering ways to take natural fibers and make more efficient use of them.
