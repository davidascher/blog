A really good book, the first that I&apos;ve liked in the &#8220;Noun&#8221; title category.

I read it a few months ago, so of course don&apos;t remember much of the details &#8212; however, I do remember that it covered an amazing swath of knowledge, from the history of the term &#8220;red herring&#8221; to the importance of La Rochelle in France, back when how much cod you could catch and how much salt you needed to make salt cod mattered. Last tidbit I remember: something like 45% of salt usage is now due to de-icing of roads.
