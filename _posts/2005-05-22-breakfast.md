Continuing on a food theme, today&#8217;s breakfast is yet another instance of my quest for the perfect &#8220;french crepe with american flour&#8221; recipe.

Today&#8217;s recipe, taken out of last week&#8217;s NYT magazine, is pretty good, with a thin batter, pretty coloring, good resiliency. It&#8217;s missing a flavor component I can&#8217;t identify, however.

Have to keep trying&#8230;
