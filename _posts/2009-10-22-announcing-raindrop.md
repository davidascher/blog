I&#8217;m thrilled to announce that we launched [Raindrop](http://labs.mozilla.com/raindrop) today.  Raindrop is Mozilla Messaging&#8217;s experiment in messaging on the open web, hosted by [Mozilla Labs](http://labs.mozilla.com/).  You should definitely go over to the introductory post, and check out the first few pages we&#8217;ve put up describing the goal of the project, how we&#8217;ve built it so far, and how we&#8217;re hoping to engage designers as well as developers to participate in the ongoing effort.

It&#8217;s going to be fun to have both an experimental platform for next-generation experiments on messaging, which leverages the web of the future, as well as a Thunderbird client which provides both an awesome desktop experience today, and lets more people build interesting, fun, and useful add-ons as well.

I want to make sure to express my thanks to everyone who contributed to Raindrop thus far: Andrew Sutherland who did some initial experiments a long time ago; Chris Anderson, Jan Lenhardt, and Damien Katz of the CouchDB project, who&#8217;ve been super helpful in helping us understand their awesome database; Bryan Clark, who&#8217;se done a great job juggling Thunderbird and Raindrop design leadership; Mark Hammond, who took Andrew&#8217;s original draft and built a great backend infrastructure (it&#8217;s great to work with Mark again!); James Burke, for whom no UI requirement is too much; Andy Chung, who makes everyone else look great; and Chris Beard, Myk Melez and Pascal Finette, of Mozilla Labs, for their advice, hosting, and feedback.

2010 will be amazing.
