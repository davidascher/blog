I enjoy talking to young companies (or proto-companies) about their projects. I do that with a few incubators and the like, and I consistently find it rewarding. I find myself always trying to tweak people&#8217;s product vision a bit, looking for a way to turn a &#8220;business idea&#8221; into something that will have deeper, human value &#8212; not just because I think it&#8217;s the moral thing to do, but because if you&#8217;re &#8220;just working for the man&#8221; (even if you are the man), then when things get tough, it&#8217;s going to be hard to get up in the morning. When you&#8217;re doing something that deeply resonates with people, and which either relies on positive human qualities or strengthens them, then I&#8217;m confident that your odds as an entrepreneur are better. Also because there are plenty of mentors who will do a better job of getting your social viral marketing plan in shape.

Sometimes I wonder whether I&#8217;m the only one getting value out of our conversations, but this blog post reassured me that at least sometimes I have an interesting impact: [Do you really need a server? Build your minimum viable product entirely client-side.](http://talsraviv.com/2012/07/20/do-you-really-need-a-server-build-your-minimum-viable-product-entirely-client-side/)

I&#8217;m particularly interested by the fact that I wasn&#8217;t really trying to force them to think about the privacy advantages of client-centric development (I realize it&#8217;s hard for budding entrepreneurs to make that a priority), simply going for the pragmatics of it all. I&#8217;m so glad it&#8217;s working out for them.
