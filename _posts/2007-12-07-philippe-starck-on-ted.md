Watching (and listening) to [Philippe Starck](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/197) is fun, and surprisingly easy to map onto my own beliefs about software and product design. A good way to end the week:

I particularly like the section in the middle about walking, and the difference between looking down, looking ahead, looking up, looking straight up, and looking inwards. It&#8217;s stunningly easy to apply to software designers.
