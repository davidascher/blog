My son is learning about proper nouns and common nouns at school. Which led to my griping last night about that particular dichotomy in English. _Iraq_ is a proper noun. That makes sense. _Iraqis_ is as well. That doesn&#8217;t &#8212; there are millions of them, if that doesn&#8217;t define &#8220;common&#8221; then I don&#8217;t know what does. To the argument that being an Iraqi is an matter of identity, I counter that if that&#8217;s true, then words like _Muslim_ should be considered proper nouns as well, but they aren&#8217;t. None of this would matter that much if I wasn&#8217;t staring at _IRAQIS_ in a recent Scrabble game, unable to use that awesome triple-word layout just staring at me.
