I&#8217;ll be in the Bay Area starting this evening for less than 24 hours (assuming no delays =).

I&#8217;ll be there again Feb 4-8 for the CalConnect roundtable and other meetings.

I&#8217;ll be in SF/Berkeley Feb 19-24 (but missing FOSDEM!).

I&#8217;ll be heading to Hamburg, Germany sometime in April or thereabouts for the Calendar face-to-face meeting, with likely other European cities thrown in the mix.
