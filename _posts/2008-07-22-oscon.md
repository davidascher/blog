[OSCON](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/content/home) is the conference that I seem to attend the most regularly. In particular, the hallway conversations are great.

Not being a Perl guy, I never went to the Perl Conference, but I was involved in organizing the first Python track at the first OSCON IIRC, and I think I&#8217;ve been every year since.

This time, for the first time, as a Mozilla rep. Dan and I will give a [talk about Thunderbird](http://en.oreilly.com/oscon2008/public/schedule/detail/2680), but I&#8217;m expecting we&#8217;ll talk about Thunderbird 18 hours a day!

See some of you there!
