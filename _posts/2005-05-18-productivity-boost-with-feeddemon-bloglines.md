  1. Install [feeddemon](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/index.asp) 1.5 trial (still trying to figure out an alternative to [bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/))
  2. Enable the [bloglines synchronization feature](http://www.bradsoft.com/feeddemon/help/1.0/bloglines/index.asp)
  3. Decide the keyboard navigation still feels awkward, and still don&#8217;t like having to read blogs in the websites (not as fast as bloglines&#8217; &#8220;everyone looks the same&#8221; model). 
  4. Go back to bloglines, and notice that _feeddemon marked all bloglines feeds as read!_
  5. Curse feeddemon
  6. Fewer blogs to read = higher productivity, knowledge be damned,
