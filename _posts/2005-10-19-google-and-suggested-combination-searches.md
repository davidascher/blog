Google impressed me today, doing something very basic and core: search.

I wanted to be reminded of the syntax for .forward files, which are unix-geeky files. So I searched for &#8220;.forward&#8221;. Google, as usual, throws away some/all punctuation in its searches, so the first batch of results were for &#8220;forward&#8221;. But then it also showed me:

> See results for: .forward file

and

> Also see .forward unix

and

> Google Groups results for .forward

All of which were right on.

Trent just found out that search for .text also shows up searches for &#8220;.text&#8221; and &#8220;dottext&#8221;. Fascinating.
