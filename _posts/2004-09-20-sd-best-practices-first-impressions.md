I&#8217;m at [SD Best Practices](http://www.sdexpo.com). First impressions:

  * Agile development has 90% of the mindshare based on the talk schedule&#8212;yet very few people seem to be doing it based on the few conversations I&#8217;ve had. It feels like a disconnect between the speakers and the audience. We&#8217;ll see if the trend is real or a statistical fluke.

  * Anyone who is a &#8216;regular attendee&#8217; (as opposed to &#8216;speaker&#8217; or &#8216;expo only&#8217;) is issued a &#8220;VIP <span class="caps">PASS</span>&#8221; badge. Did someone really think that giving a few thousand people a <span class="caps">VIP</span> label would make them feel important?

Unrelated to SD, but kinda fun: when I got to the hotel, I was informed that they&#8217;d overbooked, and so I was offered me the &#8220;choice&#8221; of paying for a room in another hotel or getting $100 paying for the hotel myself. I did the latter, which is going to save the company a chunk of change as well (the replacement hotel, was, shall we say, &#8216;down-market&#8217;). Then I went to dinner at a California _Pizza_ Kitchen restaurant (I know, I know, but it was open and I needed food), ordered a glass of wine, salad and a pizza, drank the wine and ate the salad, then waited a while, only to be told that they&#8217;d shut down the oven because they needed to prepare for an &#8220;inspection&#8221; the next day (you have to love these &#8216;surprise&#8217; inspections), and so the pizza I&#8217;d waited for for half an hour wasn&#8217;t coming. It ends pretty well&#8212;I got a generic pasta dish and they comp&#8217;ed me the entire meal. So far, Boston&#8217;s pretty cheap&#8212;disorganized, but cheap.
