[Rightscale](http://rightscale.com/) is the new name for AWS-Console (a much better name, i must say). It seems to be the easiest way to play around on Amazon&#8217;s EC2. I had a server up in minutes, with most of the delays being due to poor wifi. A neat little business model, smoothing out the wrinkles in amazon&#8217;s user experience. Kudos to them.
