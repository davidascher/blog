Sigh. Things aren&#8217;t quite right in the computer department. Thunderbird is using 170,394Kb of memory after running for 10 minutes. My hard drive is flaking out while at a conference. VPN doesn&#8217;t make it out of the conference LAN. Luckily, people are more reliable, friends are still friends and chefs can still cook.
