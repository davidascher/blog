I need a new work cell phone (or &#8220;sellephone&#8221;, as the kids say). My carrier at work (Telus) doesn&#8217;t have any of the phones I want (Nokia Series 60), and I can&#8217;t find any useful information from sites that review cellphones on any of the [phones it carries](http://www.telusmobility.com/bc/pcs/handset_home.shtml). That is a marketplace in need of some serious simplification. I won&#8217;t even go into the acronyms, incompatible standards, locale-restricted capabilities, etc.

I&#8217;ll almost certainly end up going cheap (thereby depriving someone of more margin) because I can&#8217;t trust the recommendations of peers, journalists etc. towards a particular phone, because phones have a shelf-life of 2 weeks, so reviews are obsolete before they&#8217;re published.

We don&#8217;t need twelve thousand models of phones. We really don&#8217;t.

Lazyweb, any suggestions? (For a phone, I mean &#8212; the &#8220;obvious&#8221; suggestion for fixing the industry is to combine VOIP, WLANs and a manufacturer with their head screwed on straight and provide Saturn/ING Direct type &#8220;simple&#8221; plans. Maybe can&#8217;t happen for regulatory reasons, but it should.).
