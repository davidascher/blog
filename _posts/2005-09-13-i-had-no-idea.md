When I posted my [glib comment about the penguins](http://ascher.ca/blog/2005/09/10/intelligent-design/), I had no idea that it was such a controversial topic! See [George Will&#8217;s piece in the Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/26/AR2005082601486.html) and a [followup](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/13/science/13peng.html?adxnnl=1&incamp=article_popular&adxnnlx=1126648369-e+Nle9ioqd/1Zcyi5d3R2w) in today&#8217;s NYT (and some of the comments to [my original post](http://ascher.ca/blog/2005/09/10/intelligent-design/)). Crazy country!

Update: wow, look at the results of this technorati [search on penguins & intelligent design](http://technorati.com/search/penguins+intelligent+design).
