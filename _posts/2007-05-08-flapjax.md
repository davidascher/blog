Gisle stumbled on [Flapjax](http://www.flapjax-lang.org/) yesterday, and it&#8217;s been keeping me thinking since. It clicks in quite well with what [Avi](http://smallthought.com/avi/)&#8216;s been telling me for a while, as well as some of our own thinking on webdev. A nice twist is that it&#8217;s out of Providence, a place with fond associations for me.
