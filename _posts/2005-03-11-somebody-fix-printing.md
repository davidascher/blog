I&#8217;m going to be on a few planes over the next two weeks (to San Diego for ETech, to San Francisco for a customer visit, and to DC for PyCon). I like to read when I travel, and there&#8217;s a bunch of stuff that I&#8217;ve been meaning to get to. As batteries run out and eyes tire, I like to occasionally print the more substantive pieces on dead trees. Also, I occasionally print stuff to share with people who, for reasons as diverse as network security, poor eyesight, or simple personal preferences, would rather read on paper than on a screen (it&#8217;s much easier to share [Malcolm Gladwell&#8217;s piece on SUVs](http://www.gladwell.com/2004/2004_01_12_a_suv.html) around the playground if it&#8217;s on paper).

And I have to say that way too many blogs are basically unprintable. Simply too many of them are clearly never tested for printability (uh, I should test my own&#8230; phew, it&#8217;s a bit of a small font but at least the layout&#8217;s just fine).

So, if you have a blog, please print one of your own entries once in a while, and see what it&#8217;s like. Also, if you have a popular blog where people leave lots of comments, consider making it possible to print your words and not all the comments.

There, rant over, I feel better now.
