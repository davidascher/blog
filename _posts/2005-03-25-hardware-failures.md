My hard drive is very unhappy, which means that I can&#8217;t do any of the experimental hacking I was hoping to do on the plane on the way back tomorrow.

It&#8217;s fascinating that having a drive that causes the OS to complain (mildly but scarily) when lots of new files are created has basically no impact on one&#8217;s ability to do email and web browsing.
