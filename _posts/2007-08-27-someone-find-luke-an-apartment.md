My friend Luke and his g/f are looking for an apartment. Help him!

  * Around $1000/mo, 1br
  * Close to transportation that can take him downtown (skytrain, b-line, etc.)
  * Ceilings higher than 6ft

Pass info to me, I&#8217;ll forward. If you know my activestate email, you can also guess his by knowing that his last name starts with P.
