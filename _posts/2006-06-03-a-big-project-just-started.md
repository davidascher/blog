Long time no blog.

Big personal news recently is we just bought a tiny bit of land on Gambier Island (right about [here](http://tinyurl.com/rcvlj)), which is currently fit for nothing, but hopefully with some work can become a camping spot, then maybe a place we can park a camper, and some day build something. The island is quite wild, with little development yet, and our lot is 5 minutes to the dock, from where we can see lots of water, Cypress mountain, etc.

It feels like we just embarked on a very big project. Oh well.

Step one will be clearing part of the land enough to be able to set up a tent.

Step two: If anyone knows of a cheap old camper (would love an airstream) in the neighborhood, let me know&#8230;
