I&#8217;m going over to Manhattan for the [IORG meeting](http://www.iorgforum.org/IORGConference.htm). I&#8217;d love a recommendation for a place to stay. My favorite hotels are small boutique places &#8212; I have a strong dislike for the huge chains, and I&#8217;ll pick a safe hostel over a hilton. The conference is midtown (30 W 44th Street), so anywhere within walking or cab distance from there would be ideal.
