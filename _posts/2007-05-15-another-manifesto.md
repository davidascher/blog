I&#8217;ll blog about [this one](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/mitchell/archives/2007/02/the_mozilla_manifesto_introduc.html) at some point, but the one I wanted to mention here is [this one](http://alarmingdevelopment.org/index.php?p=5), which is a good read for people who want to build better tools to let normal people make computers &#8220;do stuff&#8221;.
