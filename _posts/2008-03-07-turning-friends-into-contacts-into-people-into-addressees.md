I learn from [ROC](http://robert.accettura.com/archives/2008/03/06/gmail-thunderbird-contact-sync/) that Google released the API for [contacts](http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/03/3-2-1-contact-api-has-landed.html). As Robert mentions, it would be really interesting to see what we could do with that. Starting with an extension, but also using it to inform our thinking about how to rework the address book in Thunderbird 3. It&#8217;s not a particularly secret wish of mine that I could use Thunderbird&#8217;s address book as the hub for my various &#8220;address books&#8221;, be those Google contacts, facebook friends, dopplr fellow travelers, etc. I need to get Mark Banner (thunderbird address book expert) and Philipp Kewisch ([GData](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/sunbird/addon/4631) author) in a room&#8230;
