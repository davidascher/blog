As admonished to do so by [Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) (I do everything he tells me to do, of course), I&#8217;ve been reading [The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business as Usual](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?tag=davidaschersb-20&location=/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315%3FSubscriptionId=1P7KD2W4QQYSPAG6NC82 "View product details at Amazon")[<img class="book" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0738204315.01._SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg" alt="The Cluetrain Manifesto: The End of Business as Usual" />](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?tag=davidaschersb-20&location=/exec/obidos/ASIN/0738204315%3FSubscriptionId=1P7KD2W4QQYSPAG6NC82 "View product details at Amazon"). It&#8217;s been fun. Part of me would love to read an equally acerbic and &#8220;vociferous&#8221; rebuttal, from clued-in marketers and lawyers, who don&#8217;t defend the &#8220;bad old ways&#8221; but rather explain how to take the Cluetrain&#8217;s radical message and moderate it in the face of a marketplace that isn&#8217;t _quite_ as hip to the beat as Doc Searls _et al._ make it sound to be.
