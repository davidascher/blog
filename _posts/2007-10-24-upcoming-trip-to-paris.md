I&#8217;ll be in Paris, France, from Nov 12 to the 19th. I&#8217;ve got a few things scheduled already, but I&#8217;d be happy to organize an informal &#8220;pot&#8221; about Mozilla, MailCo, Thunderbird, or whatever interests.

Oh, and for those of you who don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m French (and American (but not Canadian)) and speak French (and English (and am even slowly learning some about the fascinating topic of [Quebec profane words](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_French_profanity))). I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m likely to blog in French anytime soon (although I admire people like Loic who manage to [blog](http://loiclemeur.com/) [bilingually](http://www.loiclemeur.com/france/)) and am only slightly apprehensive at the thought of business negotiations or deep technical talk in my native tongue, given that I&#8217;m way behind on the lingo. (In grad school, the idea of giving a scientific talk in French was fairly terrifying). Still, I&#8217;ve had a few conversations in French these last few weeks and I think they went ok.
