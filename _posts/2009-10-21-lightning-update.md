A week full of announcements:

I&#8217;ve been so busy working on the Thunderbird 3 release that I forgot to blog about this new development:  I&#8217;m pleased to announce that Mozilla Messaging has engaged Philipp Kewisch, lead of the Calendar project, to help drive the release of a version of the popular [Lightning](http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/) calendar add-on.  The plan so far is for Philipp (who&#8217;se in school, but somehow finds time to do Mozilla work after that) to help fix bugs, drive the release, and generally make sure that people who want to upgrade from Thunderbird 2 to Thunderbird 3 will find their favorite extension working there.

If you&#8217;re keen to help, let Philipp know, and participate in test days, help QA release candidates that will show up, and if you can, chip in with patches!
