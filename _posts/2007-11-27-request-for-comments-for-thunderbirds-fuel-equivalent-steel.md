One of the big topics that I&#8217;m planning to devote a fair bit of MailCo energy towards is to help the Thunderbird extension &#8220;scene&#8221;. Part of that is making it easier to make extensions for Thunderbird, with better docs, cleaner APIs where necessary, etc. One of the dreams that people have mentioned repeatedly was &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t it be great to have a [FUEL](http://wiki.mozilla.org/FUEL) for Thunderbird&#8221;, referring to John Resig & Mark Finkle&#8217;s library that makes writing extensions for Firefox much easier.

Well, imagine my joy when Joey Minta [posted on the newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.thunderbird/browse_frm/thread/e62bdf382a7f2879) that he&#8217;s started just that. He&#8217;s looking for comments on the API, so [check it out](http://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Jminta/Steel) and pitch in!
