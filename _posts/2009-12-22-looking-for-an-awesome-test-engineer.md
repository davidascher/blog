I don&#8217;t yet have a full job description handy, but figured I could start with a draft:

Mozilla Messaging is looking someone who can help us drive forward Thunderbird&#8217;s test automation framework, tooling, coverage, and community. We&#8217;re looking for someone who combines the usual skills we need:

  * Strong domain expertise: in this case test automation of a multi-platform desktop application
  * Big-picture thinking: you&#8217;d be the first paid test engineer working on a huge codebase with lots of developers and millions of users, so the hard thing won&#8217;t be to find things to do, rather figuring out what&#8217;s the right thing to work on
  * Ability to lead and build a community of peers and contributors
  * Ability to prioritize and drive your own work, and happy to collaborate with a wide variety of contributors

Our current test infrastructure relies primarily on MozMill, and most tests are written in Python or JavaScript, so solid understanding of those technologies is obviously useful.

This is a unique opportunity for someone who takes testing, engineering, and community seriously, and who wants to have a huge impact on software that is used daily by millions of people.

Relocation not necessary.

Pass the word!
