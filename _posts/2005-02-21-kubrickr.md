Found [Kubrickr](http://www.redalt.com/tools/kubrickr.php), which lets me easily change the masthead picture by cropping suitably licensed pictures from flickr. Cute. (except it doesn&#8217;t do attribution automatically &#8212; the current one is from [Stewart Butterfield)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/12037949632@N01/4399778/)
