I&#8217;d like to start collecting information about cool email experiments. To jumpstart the discussion, here are a few of my favorites:

  * IBM&#8217;s [Remail](http://www.research.ibm.com/remail/) project is inspirational.
  * Ka-Ping Yee has a tendency to come up with cool stuff, from nosy lists in [Roundup](http://zesty.ca/roundup.html) to [thread maps](http://zesty.ca/threadmap/bicycles/) and [user-directed screen reading](http://zesty.ca/udsr/)
  * Andrew Sutherland is doing [cool visualization experiments](http://www.visophyte.org/blog/), including [with Thunderbird](http://www.visophyte.org/blog/category/mozilla/thunderbird/)
  * [GNUmail](http://www.collaboration-world.com/gnumail/) is a project Andrew mentioned which I need to read up on.

What other projects should I know about?

[UPDATE: Please don&#8217;t just suggest mail clients &#8212; My mention of GNUmail sent people astray, as I forgot to mention that it was notable because it implemented the arc-threading view. I&#8217;m not interested in an inventory of wholesale mail clients &#8212; only an inventory of specific features, or even better yet, not-yet-feature-but-ideas which show innovation and promise]
