> &#8220;It&#8217;s like YouTube for \___&#8221;

For a non-investor, I end up hearing a lot of pitches.  I even make pitches of my own (not for companies, but for product ideas &#8212; same basic idea).  Around Mozilla, we tend to say that things are &#8220;like the web&#8221; or &#8220;very Mozilla&#8221;.  Those are equally fuzzy analogies, which assume a shared conceptual map &#8212; a dangerous assumption. What if your audience thinks of the web as a scary, confusing, complicated place? or have a Mozilla concept that is anchored by a dinosaur?

In the startup world, a quick glance at <a href="https://angel.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Angel List</a> shows how prevalent that phrase is among budding entrepreneurs.  It&#8217;s clearly both trendy and attractive to rely on other successes to explain your concept.  I&#8217;m here to warn you about what may be an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attractive_nuisance_doctrine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">attractive nuisance</a>, but suggest a simple way to do it better.

Whenever you say something like &#8220;It&#8217;s like YouTube for __\_\\_\_&#8221;, or &#8220;like Pinterest but for \_\___,&#8221; you hope you&#8217;re concisely communicating a key part of your business or product idea but you could easily miss the mark, and not know it.  Analogies work to the extent that the analog is a concise description of a key concept, which you&#8217;re applying to a different market. The problem is that _products, and especially successful products,_ are not that simple.  If I say &#8220;like YouTube&#8221;, my interlocutor will have a very different set of words pop into their minds depending on whether they&#8217;re an Italian judge, my kid, a devops, or a music industry executive.  The people you pitch to likely think differently than you do (after all, that&#8217;s likely why you want their attention, time, money, patches, whatever).  It&#8217;s therefore much too easy to confuse rather than elucidate.

My advice is to refrain from saying &#8220;like \____ for \___&#8221;, even though it feels nice to glow in the reflected glory from these successful precursors.

You can do better, and you should: there&#8217;s usually _something_ in that appealing analogy which is the concept you&#8217;re trying to convey, so focus on that _aspect_ of the inspiring product.  &#8220;It&#8217;s got the same instant gratification of Instagram, but with \_\\_\_&#8221;.  &#8220;It&#8217;s as disruptive to an enterprise market as MySQL was, but targeting the  \_\__ market&#8221;.  By making the analogy precise, you bring your audience along where you want them, and you show that you understand one of the many reasons why these products were successful.
