I waited until I could replicate the first experimental result before  
publishing, but now I can confirm it: the best croissants in Vancouver  
are those from Saffron on fourth ave. Baked on the premises (out of the  
oven at 8:30am), they are by far the best I&#8217;ve sampled in the last 6  
years of looking. Everybody go there and make sure they stay in  
business!
