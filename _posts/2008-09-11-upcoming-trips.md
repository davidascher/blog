As usual, I&#8217;m happy to coordinate and meet with people, whether for meals, drinks, or regular meetings. I&#8217;ll be:

In San Francisco and Mountain view next week, from Tuesday night till Friday evening.

In Quebec, Oct 9 & 10, for [CLLAP](http://www.cllap.qc.ca/), where I&#8217;ll give my first talk in French. Brr.

In Barcelona, Oct 25 & 26, for [MozCamp EU 2008](https://wiki.mozilla.org/EU_MozCamp_2008).

In Paris, just before or after Barcelona, because it&#8217;s on the way.

(tripit and dopplr don&#8217;t seem to be working so well at sharing this kind of info, so far. too bad)
