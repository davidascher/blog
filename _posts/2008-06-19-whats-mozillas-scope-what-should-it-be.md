A couple of canadians (!) have recently put up interesting posts about the Mozilla Foundation: [David Eaves](http://eaves.ca/2008/06/10/the-open-web-is-a-social-movement/trackback/), with whom I had a great breakfast a few weeks ago, and [Marc Surman](http://commonspace.typepad.com/commonspace/2008/06/the-next-million-mozillians.html), with whom I had a great long-distance phone chat. Both posts are worth reading, and digesting.

For what it&#8217;s worth, I agree with both.

I agree with David that the people involved in the open web (and that includes all wikipedia authors, youtube uploaders, and consumers of the same) are part of a social movement, whether they self-identify or not. I&#8217;m really interested to learn from him and people like him what the history of social movements can tell us about how to take what has traditionally been a very geeky concept (open standards, open source, etc.), and make it politically and socially not just relevant but critical and much more powerful than it is today. The &#8220;opposition&#8221; is much more astute at manipulating both courts and markets to their advantage, but that will shift if we&#8217;re ambitious enough.

I also agree w/ Marc that the Mozilla Foundation can do a lot more than what it does today, in shaping, energizing, and facilitating that movement. Especially when I&#8217;m outside of North America, it&#8217;s the Foundation that has credibility, and that credibility is currently languishing, unleveraged. We could and should do more.

It&#8217;s nice to see that the Mozilla galaxy is growing up enough that there can be simultaneous energy towards [one thing](http://www.spreadfirefox.com/), and very different but also important energy towards this complementary set of thought processes.

Oh, for the record: when I say _open web_ these days, I mean something much broader and richer than just &#8220;the WWW using open standards&#8221;, although that&#8217;s the definition that I first used. Thunderbird&#8217;s goals, for example, are in scope, even if it doesn&#8217;t have much to do with traditional web protocols yet. Things like data portability, identity 2.0, net neutrality, data privacy, etc., are all in scope. Trying to pin down exactly what I mean with that word is something I&#8217;m trying to figure out &#8212; as David mentions, we need to do a better job of defining what we&#8217;re agreeing on.

I look forward to the conversations.
