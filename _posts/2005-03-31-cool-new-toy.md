Just bought software today: [wikidpad](http://www.jhorman.org/wikidPad/). It&#8217;s outliner meets wiki meets IDE meets Lotus Agenda. It&#8217;s $12, and it&#8217;s built with Python. I&#8217;ve filed a half-dozen bugs so far, and am not sure I&#8217;m &#8220;getting&#8221; it all, but I like where it&#8217;s heading. As soon as I figure out the plugin model, I&#8217;ll be happy as a clam.
