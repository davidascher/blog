In my years of using Thunderbird, there have been a few notable transition points in my personal experience with it. One that I remember well is when we optimized deletion to be asynchronous, which completely got rid of the delay in deleting messages. Another that I&#8217;m happy to be able to share now is Jonathan Protzenko&#8217;s Conversations add-on, now available through [this Labs blog post](https://mozillalabs.com/messaging/2010/12/07/announcing-thunderbird-conversations/). It&#8217;s remarkable how well Jonathan was able to take an early mockup from a couple of years ago and carry it through to a very, very useful and pleasant and quite full-featured conversation view. Try it out, if you&#8217;re like me you won&#8217;t want to go back.

On a technical note, it&#8217;s nice to see how the various bits of the refactorings and new technology pieces we&#8217;ve been building into Thunderbird can be used to build compelling new UIs.

Congrats Jonathan!
