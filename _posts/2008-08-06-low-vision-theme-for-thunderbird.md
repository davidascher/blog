I&#8217;m getting several requests for a theme for Thunderbird which is designed for low-vision users. In particular, with an aging population, a theme which has large, high contrast fonts would be really welcome.

Does anyone know of such a thing?

I&#8217;ve seen various attempts at hacking userChrome.css, but doesn&#8217;t count as a good answer for this market either, although it&#8217;s a start.

As an aside, the over-60? crowd is a market that Thunderbird could be a good match for, given some work in the product, packaging, support & distribution.
