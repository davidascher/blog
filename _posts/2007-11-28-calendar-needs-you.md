As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, the Mozilla Calendar project, which includes the Lightning calendar extension to Thunderbird, is moving right along. It&#8217;s currently at version 0.7, heading towards a 0.8 release ASAP. I&#8217;ve asked the Calendar team how I can help, and the answer has been clear &#8212; they need more developers. So if you&#8217;ve been sitting on the sidelines of either Calendar or Thunderbird and you want some suggestions as to where you could help, check out [this bug list](http://tinyurl.com/yr2d8z). Moving Lightning forward is one of the easiest ways to help move Thunderbird forward &#8212; the codebase is in quite a healthy state, there&#8217;s an active group of daily contributors (check out the #calendar IRC channel to meet them), the [roadmap](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Calendar:Roadmap) is clear, and the bugs are clearly marked.
