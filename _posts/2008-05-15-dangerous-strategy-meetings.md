I just got back from doing a podcast for [RainCity Radio](http://www.raincitystudios.com/audio), with [Zak](http://zak.greant.com/), [Boris](http://bmannconsulting.com/), and [Dave Olson](http://www.raincitystudios.com/about/team/daveo) as host.

The podcast was fun, as was the conversation afterwards with Zak and Boris. Unfortunately, the day was so beautiful that we went out for a beer to complement our strategy brainstorming. Nothing like drinking a good belgian beer in the sun to impact the afternoon&#8217;s productivity! Still, it resulted in some ideas bouncing around in our heads, and time will tell which ones survive.

Given that my brain was a bit shot, I decided to do what I seem to do now that I don&#8217;t have TV &#8212; watch some TED videos (preferably with Miro). I know, it&#8217;s awfully highbrow, but it&#8217;s what I seem to have lying around. I watched two. A [relaxing one about artistic juggling](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/260), which is fun to watch, and [Dave Eggers&#8217; TED Prize wish video](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/233), which simply should be watched. Take the time and watch it, it&#8217;s butt-kickingly inspirational.
