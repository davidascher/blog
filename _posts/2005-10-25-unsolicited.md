As part of my job, my name gets listed on the corporate website. As a result, I end up with a fair share of spam, and spam-like phone calls. I just got off the phone with someone pitching me backup storage software. To save everyone time, I tend to cut off those calls very fast, as I know pretty quickly which products and services I&#8217;m even remotely interested or likely to be a customer for, and which ones I&#8217;m not. The strange thing is a couple of minutes after I hung up, I got:

> Hi David,
> 
> This is in reference to my call to you right now.
> 
> _Please note this isn&#8217;t an unsolicited call or email._ You didn&#8217;t allow me to  
> finish.

(I&#8217;ll skip the rest, as I don&#8217;t particularly want to advertise or demonize the individual or the company). The startling point is italicized above. My reply:

> Of course it is. I never asked you to call or email.
> 
> Best of luck.

> &#8211;david
