First day at [PyCon 2005](www.pycon.org/dc2005/). It&#8217;s, as usual, interesting. Random bits:

  * Crowded! It&#8217;s bigger than ever, clocking in over 400. It&#8217;s caused some headaches of the good kind (catering more expensive than planned, not enough t-shirts, rooms are packed).
  * Not too surprisingly given the buzz around Python, there are big names (although we&#8217;ve had big names at Python conferences for years). This year it&#8217;s Jim Hugunin from Microsoft, Greg Stein from Google, and we&#8217;ll see who else).
  * More interesting to me, a lot of old friends, including many who used to come at conferences, then stopped, and are now back. I don&#8217;t know if it has anything to do with Python itself, the economy in general, or it&#8217;s just random &#8212; but it&#8217;s nice to touch base again.
  * It&#8217;s only been three hours, so it&#8217;s a bit hard to know for sure yet, but it seems as though there&#8217;s more money around &#8212; more startups, some VC influences, and a greater proportion of people who do Python for their jobs, not just for love

Washington DC is still a great city, the Rouge Hotel still has attitude and free broadband, and I&#8217;m looking forward to good dinners with old friends.
