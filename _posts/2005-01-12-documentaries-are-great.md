Strange to follow the Apple post with this one, but hey&#8230; Last night I watched two documentaries &#8212; one on celebrated photojournalists honored for their work in 2004 (&#8220;In the life on fire&#8221;, produced by the BBC), and one on [culture jamming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_jamming) ([&#8220;CultureJam&#8221;](http://www.culturejamthefilm.com/index.html)). Both are recommended. In fact, I record pretty much every documentary that the CBC puts out, and I&#8217;m rarely dissapointed (and when I am, it&#8217;s two seconds to delete and move on to the next one!).
