One of the things I liked about grad school was that I got a broader education than you could reasonably expect. As an example, I was reminded tonight of a movie that my first advisor, Jim Anderson, showed us one day, Claude Lelouch&#8217;s [Rendez-vous](), which I learned via [Loic](http://www.loiclemeur.com/english/2005/01/paris_as_you_ha.html) is now on the web.

It&#8217;s all about the [video](http://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/~se014/rendezvous20_04.mov), which is a stroll through Paris in one early morning of 1976, in a Ferrari 275/GTB. Paris has changed quite a bit since then!
