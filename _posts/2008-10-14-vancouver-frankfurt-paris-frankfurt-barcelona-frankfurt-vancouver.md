I&#8217;ll be in Paris next week for a few days, with both main days already quite full of meetings. Then I&#8217;m heading to Barcelona for MozCamp EU, which should be great. Then I&#8217;m taking some vacation days in Barcelona, which might even be better.

As the title indicates, I&#8217;ll also be spending lots of quality time in the Frankfurt airport as well, but likely unable to meet except with fellow travelers.

As always, I&#8217;m happy to try and schedule meetings with whoever wants to talk about Thunderbird, email, Mozilla, or anything else.
