Briefly:

  1. I now have a &#8220;work blog&#8221; over at <http://blogs.activestate.com/davida>, where I&#8217;ll be able to speak about things like programming languages, what I do all day, and the like on a more regular basis. 
  2. I&#8217;m off to portland for a week of conferences, and, ideally, buying a car (very, very long story).
