Drive-by bits:

  * Saw [this](http://crashopensource.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/thunderbird-bug-fixing-lab-an-up-close-and-personal-lesson-on-patch-review/) in google alerts, about one person&#8217;s process of fixing a thunderbird bug. It&#8217;s nice to see how getting involved and scratching itches is seen as easy by at least one contributor. We need more of that. 
  * In case people didn&#8217;t notice, Shane&#8217;s [looking for a Komodo dev](http://blogs.activestate.com/shanec/2007/11/next-step-for-k.html). Cool stuff. 
  * Rhetorical question: Why is it that when you see people walking in the street it&#8217;s so easy to think poorly of them without knowing anything, and when you talk and listen to people, it&#8217;s so easy to find things to like about them?
  * I&#8217;ve had lots of great conversations this week. Very energizing. As a result, I&#8217;m behind on my email. Apologies to many.
  * I got a visit this week from a few people including the [PyPy](http://codespeak.net/pypy/dist/pypy/doc/news.html) crew, who gave a fun presentation to me, some of the [ActiveState folks](http://www.activestate.com/company/people.plex), Sun&#8217;s [Tim Bray](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/), and Avi & Andrew from [DabbleDB](http://dabbledb.com/)/[Seaside](http://www.seaside.st/). Language geeks all. Apparently they&#8217;re going to give a google talk, which should make its way on the web at some point. Language geeks should keep an eye out for it. 
  * Another visitor who tagged along was Aza Raskin, from [Humanized](http://www.humanized.com/), and it was fun to talk about advanced user interface ideas. 
  * I&#8217;m heading to Paris for the next week, to talk to customers, interview possible hires, get to know the [Mozilla Europe](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/) crew, drink some wine, eat some food, see friends & family. It&#8217;s just a quick trip, I promise I&#8217;ll do a broader European tour sometime later, as I know there&#8217;s lots and lots of interesting conversations to have there
  * It&#8217;s been true for a while that when I buy a computer, the manufacturer takes that as the signal to roll out an upgrade. Can that be generalized to: &#8220;When I head for Paris, the strikes start?&#8221;
  * Is it possible to buy a SIM card in Paris that I could plop into my iPhone and have a working phone?
