I just discovered a new option for lunch in the neighborhood of work: [Delicados](http://www.delicados-deli.com/Ca/index.html), on [West Hastings & Richards](http://tinyurl.com/l6hjz). At the recommendation of the person at the counter, I had a half-roll-up (w/ chicken) and a side salad (3-bean), and both were excellent. Flavorful, spicy (there&#8217;s a 9-point spice scale, and I picked &#8220;medium+&#8221;, which was fine for me), filling without being too much. (the half-wrap was a bit on the smaller side, but that&#8217;s ok).

Tentatively: 3 stars out of 5, with possible revisions depending on how further experiments go.
