Before I forget. After weeks of hard work, I finally came up with a good use case for Twitter. Skiing.

More specifically, out [here](http://maps.google.com/?ie=UTF8&z=12&ll=49.313037,-123.116226&spn=0.198305,0.371475&om=1), you can decide to go skiing at a whim. It takes 30-45 minutes to make your way onto the hill. But conditions are sometimes iffy. You can check out the hill&#8217;s [website](http://cypressmountain.com/index.asp), but that&#8217;s highly biased information. I want real-time user generated data from people on the slopes. And they have cellphones. Now I just need them to publish data. Next season, if Twitter is still in business (and hasn&#8217;t [collapsed](http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/) [under](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000608.html) the [load](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2007/04/16/dhh-translation)), I might just print out some stickers and plaster them in the lodge&#8230;

I knew there was a purpose for the thing.
