Clay Shirky has another [great essay out](http://www.herecomeseverybody.org/2008/04/looking-for-the-mouse.html), which I recommend you go read now.

Just like [Robert Sayre](http://blog.mozilla.com/rob-sayre/2008/04/26/here-comes-everybody/), I find it resonating with me, in a few ways. First, I certainly see the societal possibilities of amplifying what feels like an already existing trend. Second, the writers&#8217; strike was for me a great personal kick in the pants that I needed to watch less TV. It&#8217;s as if the drug dealer is out of dope, and so you find that you can just do other things with your time, and you find you don&#8217;t miss the thing! Third, while my thinking on Thunderbird 3 has long been about how to make it fit within a web-enabled world, Clay&#8217;s piece explains both the higher level why: &#8220;enabling an architecture of participation&#8221;, and a metaphorical how: &#8220;mice&#8221; everywhere (if you didn&#8217;t read the essay, that won&#8217;t make sense), so that Thunderbird developers, add-on developers, communication channel providers, and most broadly Thunderbird users can find mice that fit their hands.
