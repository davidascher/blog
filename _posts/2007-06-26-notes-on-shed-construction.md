A few resources I&#8217;m finding useful in building a shed:

  1. A neat [kit](http://www.leevalley.com/garden/page.aspx?c=2&p=51679&cat=2,2180,33227) from Lee Valley, which includes a detailed plan for a basic shed, including a parts list, and hardware that should make attaching the roof trusses easy (I hope!), 
  2. Also acquired at Lee Valley, a reprint of a classic book published by the US Department of Agriculture Forest Service a million years ago (well, no, in 1969), with the charming title &#8220;[Low-cost wood homes construction manual](http://www.leevalley.com/wood/page.aspx?c=&p=51540&cat=1,46096,46100)&#8221; 
  3. A text called &#8220;[Advanced Wall Framing](http://www.toolbase.org/pdf/techinv/oveadvancedframingtechniques_techspec.pdf -)&#8221; which came in handy to make me feel better about a mistake I made in one of the few deviations from the plan that I made.
