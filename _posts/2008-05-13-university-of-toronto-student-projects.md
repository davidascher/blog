What feels like years ago, my friend [Greg Wilson](http://pyre.third-bit.com/), a [book](http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-Code-Leading-Programmers-Practice/dp/0596510047) [author](http://www.amazon.com/Data-Crunching-Everyday-Problems-Python/dp/0974514071) CS prof at the University of Toronto with a deep understanding of both the practical realities of software engineering and open source, roped me into being a &#8220;client&#8221; for a class he teaches on software engineering, where he matches students with open source projects, and gets the projects to act as if they were typical clients. I have to say, I behaved like a typical bad client. Fuzzy requirements, lousy documentation on our system, erratic email, never around to meet in person, etc.

Still, the two students assigned to me, Mike Wu and Ronald Fung, did a great job. Ronald Fung led a messy part of the project, which was about teaching Thunderbird how to detect RSS/Atom feeds in pages that mention feeds but aren&#8217;t feeds themselves, work which will likely make its way into Thunderbird 3 at some point. Thanks!

Mike Wu led the development of a _Remember The Milk_ provider to Lightning, the calendaring add-on to Thunderbird. RTM is a popular website for tracking TODOs, so it seemed a good alternative storage mechanism for Lightning users (alternatively, Lightning seemed like a good front end for RTM users). [That add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/addon/7125) is now on addons.mozilla.org. Nice job!
