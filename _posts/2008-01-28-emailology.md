If I had more acting chops, I&#8217;d love to make a [parody video](http://gawker.com/349857/the-ultimate-tom-cruise-scientology-parody-video-roundup) of the [Tom Cruise video](http://gawker.com/5002269/the-cruise-indoctrination-video-scientology-tried-to-suppress), where I&#8217;m blathering on about fixing email. &#8220;If you see a bad From: header, you have to stop and help&#8221;. &#8220;I do what I can, and I do it the way I do everything (insert maniacal laugther&#8230;)&#8221;.
