After a few weeks heads-down work in code for a demo, I got to look up and read, watch, learn. The highlights.

Ted.com has an updated website, with high quality videos on important topics, and lots of them. So far I saw [Bill Clinton](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/85) (a really good presenter, it&#8217;s impressive to watch), and I want to [see](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/92) [more](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/83). (Found first through [Paul Kedrosky&#8217;s feed](http://paul.kedrosky.com/), which is an interesting mixture of stuff I really don&#8217;t care about and stuff I do care about). A friend also forwarded me a link to

Andreas Kupries pointed me to a paper mentioned by [Jean-Claude Wippler](http://www.equi4.com/jcw/) called [Magic Ink](http://worrydream.com/MagicInk/). It&#8217;s a brilliant paper about user interface design, or the lack of it. In the vein of Tufte, but much more applied to software. The tail end of the paper is a little too fluffy for my taste, and the paper would have been better without it, but that&#8217;s a minor flaw on what I hope will be an influential paper. I&#8217;ll try and get people to read it, but it&#8217;s too long for many.

Saw two good movies recently: [After the wedding](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=3&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Ftrailers%2Findependent%2Fafterthewedding%2Ftrailer%2F&ei=_MEnRqPBKYOqgwOdhZyvDw&usg=AFrqEze-YUaKfOalbq1pNhMnVTcIBTelgw&sig2=dV53qAFyj3I4JRajycc3RQ), a Danish movie about a family (hard to say more without revealing the plot), and [The Squid and the Whale](http://www.apple.com/trailers/independent/thesquidandthewhale.html), a movie about kids and a couple divorcing. Both recommended.

Next on the list of movies to see: [Das Leben Der Anderen](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/), a movie about the Stasi in East Germany.

A [fascinating paper](http://nymag.com/news/features/27840/) in New York Magazine about the work of [Carol Dweck](http://www-psych.stanford.edu/~dweck/), whose research seems to show how indiscriminate praising of kids and telling kids they&#8217;re smart leads to under-performing and lack of confidence. Important reading for parents and parents-to-be.

For fun: Luke Closs [juggling at Web 2.0 expo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9BbL2G_wMI).

Quote of the dayfrom [Dwell Creative&#8217;s manifesto](http://www.dwellcreative.com/manifesto.html):

> No good ever came from a doomed relationship. Except The Beatles. 

I think I&#8217;m already sick of the new graphic design on this site (in particular, it looks bad on IE). I&#8217;ll have to find something else to steal.

Finally, a warning: I just ordered a MacBook, so you can expect Apple to announce a new line of laptops by the middle of next week.
