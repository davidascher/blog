I&#8217;ve been meaning to advertise for the folks at 106.3FM [Aboriginal Voices Radio](http://aboriginalvoices.com/). I&#8217;m not particularly receptive to most discussions around &#8220;first nations&#8221; issues, which is how Canadians refer to their aboriginal population, but I have to say that Emily and I are really enjoying Aboriginal Radio as a local station that seems to have a great supply of world music of all types, with no advertising, and remarkable variety. I still wish I could listen to NPR over the air, but this is better than anything else we&#8217;ve found so far. (No, the CBC doesn&#8217;t do it for me).
