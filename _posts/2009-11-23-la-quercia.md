Emily and I were treated to an impressive meal yesterday &#8212; a 9-course tasting menu at [La Quercia](http://laquercia.ca).

The full sequence:

Cocktail: La Bicicletta

Parmesan Sformato, Aged Balsamico

Frisee, Hazelnut & Apple Cider vinaigrette  
Roast Quail

Vitello tonnato

Strudel ai Funghi  
wild mushroom and ricotta strudel

Risotto with wild mushrooms

Agnolotti di Guido  
Stuffed pasta, veal, chard, ricotta, parmigiano

Spaghetti al&#8217;amatriciana  
Smoked pork cheek, chillies, san marzano tomatoes

Ruby Trout  
lemon caper sauce

Collo d&#8217;Agnello Brasato  
slow- braised lamb neck, beans and greens

Lemon cream

Flourless Chocolate Cake

Rice Pudding with Blueberry Sauce

with a Casalone 2004 Rus Monferato.

Almost everything was very good. The vitello tonatto was a revelation; the risotto was luscious; the chocolate cake was superb; the lemon cream inspiring. Only real complaints is it was just too much, and I don&#8217;t think we really appreciated the mains because we were full already. Apparently it&#8217;s an easier meal for larger groups, because there are a few people around who end up really, really, really hungry. Next time, I think we&#8217;ll go for either the 5-course tasting menu or just pasta & salad.

Definitely recommended, especially if someone else is paying. Reservations almost always needed apparently.
