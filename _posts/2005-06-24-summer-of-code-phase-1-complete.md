A few minutes ago, the official rankings were closed for the PSF-mentored projects for the Google Summer of Code. I don&#8217;t know yet how many slots the PSF will get, but we had enough &#8220;appropriate&#8221; mentors for 19 projects that we felt quite good about. It was both hard and easy to triage 300+ applications. Easy because some applicants clearly didn&#8217;t think very hard (or care, it seems). Hard because no matter how much people put in the application process, and how good the applications were, we were limited by the number of mentors available, the time available to do the ranking, and some technical issues. Still, I&#8217;m quite looking forward to seeing how this group of clearly motivated, bright students do over the summer &#8212; and, how well the mentorship process goes. It&#8217;ll be a first for all of us.
