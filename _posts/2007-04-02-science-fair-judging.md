Unfortunately this year I have a conflict, and can&#8217;t participate in the Greater Vancouver Regional Science Fair. They need judges, though, so if you feel at all qualified (a background in the sciences is a good prerequisite, but no judging background is required), [sign up](http://reg.gvrsf.ca/) for the afternoon of April 12th. It&#8217;s fun!
