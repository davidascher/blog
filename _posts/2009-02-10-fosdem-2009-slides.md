Just so I don&#8217;t forget, here are my slides from FOSDEM. I&#8217;m hoping to find some time to write my thoughts about the conference, but that&#8217;s not going to happen today.

<div style="width:425px;text-align:left;" id="__ss_1014329">

</div>

I had some really good conversations after the talk, so it seemed to at least be interesting to people, which was the main goal.
