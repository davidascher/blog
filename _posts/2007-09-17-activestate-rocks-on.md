Unavoidably, [my taking on a new job at Mozilla](http://ascher.ca/blog/2007/09/17/joining-mozilla/) means that I&#8217;ll be leaving my old one behind. After eight years, that&#8217;s something that begs commenting, especially if to those who&#8217;ve known me primarily through my various roles at [ActiveState](http://activestate.com/).

ActiveState has been a tremendous home for me for many years. Throughout my tenure I&#8217;ve grown tremendously as an engineer, a manager, an &#8220;open source guy&#8221;, and hopefully as a friend and colleague. It&#8217;s going to take some adjustment to not be an Activator.

At the same time, I think my leaving ActiveState is the right thing to do, not just for me, but for ActiveState as well. ActiveState is in better shape now than it&#8217;s been in years, with a strong CEO who knows how to nurture his team, a supportive board, a solid core business providing support for dynamic languages to people and companies worldwide, an [exciting adventure](http://blogs.activestate.com/shanec/2007/09/holy-komodo.html) for our collective child, Komodo, and some [intriguing possibilities](http://ascher.ca/blog/2007/08/17/a-facebook-story/) in the hyper-growth arena of social networking platforms. ActiveState is poised to do great things, they&#8217;ll do so just fine without me around on a daily basis. My leaving will allow the organization to evolve, and I&#8217;m confident it will be for the better. The best bit is that I&#8217;ll have a great ongoing role as an advisor, so I&#8217;ll still get to talk to my friends and participate in the most fun discussions. I&#8217;ll stay based in Vancouver, which will make it quite a bit simpler.

It&#8217;s a testament to the depth of relationships I&#8217;ve formed at ActiveState that _everyone_&#8216;s reaction when hearing of the reasons for my leaving was the same: &#8220;Congratulations.&#8221; They understood that &#8220;the mozilla mail thing&#8221; is a unique gig. Thanks, [all](http://activestate.com/company/people.plex), for everything.

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll blog about ActiveState news periodically, as projects like [OpenKomodo](http://activestate.com/openkomodo) evolve.
