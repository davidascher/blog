So the airstream comes with a built-in 8-track player. I didn&#8217;t have any 8-tracks (imagine!). Luckily, craigslist is here to facilitate all these weird transactions. Now I have a box of 69 8-tracks, most of them in the original packaging, to build a soundtrack for Gambier. A delightful mixture of &#8220;hits of today&#8221;, crooners, country, disco, &#8220;flashback to the 60s&#8221; and others. The hardest part will be figuring out where to store them!
