David is pleased with his weekend efforts, fixing the hydraulic clutch on the suburban by himself, replacing the converter on the trailer (thereby getting rid of the annoying buzz, and understanding one more bit of the puzzle), and fixing hugo and sylvia&#8217;s fishing lines, which he&#8217;s sure is what allowed the catching of a rockfish and a butter sole.
