  The icons above correspond to the applications I use to get information: podcasts (iTunes), email and the web (Firefox), email and source code changes (Thunderbird), IRC conversations (Colloquy), instant messaging (Adium), and blogs (NetNewsWire). (Then there&#8217;s meatspace information channels like conversations, meetings, newspapers, books, etc., but they don&#8217;t have pretty icons like the above).

I&#8217;m a pretty sophisticated user of each of these technologies. I spend a lot of time reading. But even if I spent every single minute reading, there&#8217;s no way I could know what I want to know.  
I could spend a week or so triaging, sorting, prioritizing, filtering, subscribing and unsubscribing, building custom search engines and the like, but then I&#8217;d only be more behind!  
Don&#8217;t mind me, just ranting&#8230;
