A popular book which dissappointed me. Like [Color](books/color.html), it does one chapter per topic: 

[<img class="book" hspace="5" vspace="5" border="1" align="right" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0375760393.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg" />](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375760393)

  1. Desire: Sweetness / Plant: The Apple
  2. Desire: Beauty / Plant: The Tulip
  3. Desire: Intoxication / Plant: Marijuana
  4. Desire: Control / Plant: The Potato

I found the chapters uneven. Apple and Marijuana were quite good, the other  
two quite repetitive. 

The chapter on apples was  
most intersting from a historical point of view &#8212; apples don&apos;t hybridize  
like most plants &#8212; the discovery of a good line is seemingly always the  
result of deliberate and careful horticulture, and a good apple cultivar  
can make its discoverer a fortune, if properly marketed &#8212; cf. the Red  
Delicious. 

The chapter on marijuana was the most humorous, especially the bit where  
the author tells of his experiements growing very (very) large plants, in a  
small town where the local sheriff tends to stop by for innocuous reasons.

The story of tulips (focusing on the investing craze in europe in the  
1600&apos;s) was a tad frustrating because it combined good writing about  
the appeal of the plants (and I&apos;m really not much of a flower-lover, so  
it&apos;s saying something) with not-so-great writing about the historically  
important &apos;bubble&apos;. I don&apos;t even remember the potato chapter, which  
probably means I was asleep when I read it. The book, like many  
non-fiction books I&apos;ve read recently,  
tends to be repetitive, which gets quickly annoying.
