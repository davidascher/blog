Jon Udell [asks](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/15.html#a1114) what to call his experiments with downloadable narrated demos of software. He&#8217;s looking for a name that describes:

  * A progressively-downloadable video,
  * which shows interaction with software,
  * as is narrated by a presenter,
  * or as emerges in a conversation.

I think he&#8217;s got the requirements wrong. What&#8217;s interesting about what Jon&#8217;s been doing, from my point of view anyway isn&#8217;t so much the fact that it&#8217;s progressively downloadable, or even that it&#8217;s a video. What&#8217;s important is that it&#8217;s a recorded presentation of commercial software as demonstrated to a smart, critical, independent journalist. It could be presented as punch-out origami or a slide show or even a few screen shots, and it would be equally valid (although possibly less accessible!).

Video/continuous screen captures are useful, not because they are animations (although that helps convey the &#8216;feel&#8217; of an app, much like screen captures convey the &#8216;look&#8217;), but mostly because they record everything, including bugs, mumblings and uh-oh&#8217;s. Equally important is the fact that the recordings are subject to _Jon&#8217;s_ editing, not the vendor&#8217;s, along with Jon&#8217;s willingness to ask uncomfortable questions. I remember very well demoing an early version of Komodo to Jon in a hotel room at OSCON &#8212; his combination of charm and very pointed questions is what makes him a superior journalist in my eyes (and an influential one in the eyes of many, much more important folks =). I&#8217;ve done lots of product demos and interviews with the press, and I&#8217;ll take someone like Jon anyday over someone who just wants to hear a pitch (not that I&#8217;m too keen on journalists who just try and destroy people, products or companies just out of a sense of combativeness).

My thoughts about what to call the medium have less to do with technology and more with journalism. So I&#8217;m going to suggest &#8220;**product interview**&#8221; as a concept, although as a name it&#8217;s far from great. It&#8217;s a record of what a journalist does when trying to extract information about a product, rather than a person. The product speaks through its user interface as well as through its voice-enabled puppet ;-), but the product is what&#8217;s being exposed for the audience.

As a shameless aside, I&#8217;ve been meaning to mention Rami Kayyali&#8217;s (totally unprompted by us) [review of Komodo](http://www.ramikayyali.com/archives/2004/08/26/komodo3). He never talked to us about it, and he&#8217;s clearly more of a product fan than a critical journalist, but I think he&#8217;s a better reviewer than most journalists are. Thanks, Rami &#8212; you don&#8217;t know how thrilled people around work were to read that blog entry. It was nice to see that you &#8220;got&#8221; what a lot of what we are trying to do is about.
