UPDATED: see the end

As part of a release (say, for the sake of illustration, the next alpha of Thunderbird), we try to run the software through a set of tests. The more widespread the release, the more tests. Nightlies don&#8217;t go through any non-automated tests. The final release will go through a lot. For an alpha, we like to have a few people poke at the software on each of the major platforms, to make sure that the major bits work.

We have volunteers covering Mac and Windows, but we&#8217;re short a couple of Linux volunteers. All it should take is 1) access to a linux box (the more mainstream the better), 2) experience with Thunderbird and ideally with Linux, 3) a bugzilla account, and 4) a couple of hours of free time.

If you&#8217;re interested, contact me (email is findable from [my blog home page](http://ascher.ca/blog/)), or contact Wayne Mery directly if you know how to do that.

UPDATE: We&#8217;ve had _overwhelming_ response to this post, in part thanks to a mention in Linux Magazin in Germany. We don&#8217;t need any more Linux smoke testers specifically, but we&#8217;re always eager to see more people help with Thunderbird testing. If that describes you, please subscribe or join or follow the mozilla.dev.quality newsgroup/[mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/dev-quality)/[google group](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.quality), and check out the [Thunderbird:Test wiki page](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Testing). There are lots of ways to help, and some of them take only a little bit of effort. Thanks again for the enthusiastic response!
