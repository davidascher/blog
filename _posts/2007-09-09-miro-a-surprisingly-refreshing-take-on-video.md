Motivated by seeing people like [Mike Shaver](http://shaver.off.net/diary/) and [John Lilly](http://john.jubjubs.net/2007/08/14/awesome-opportunity-mixing-mission-impact-business/) talking about it, I gave [Miro](http://www.getmiro.com/) (n√©e Democracy) another shot. I&#8217;m hooked. It&#8217;s a very refreshing take on video &#8212; finding, downloading, and playing. I&#8217;ve been filling the odd 10-minute spare time chunks with videos from [TED.com](http://www.ted.com/index.php), which are inspiring and entertaining. Recent favorites:

  * [A medical illustrator worthy of pixar](http://www.ted.com/talks/view/id/147)
  * [Great music](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/158)
  * [Amazing dance](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/24)
  * [Wacky art](http://www.ted.com/speakers/view/id/144)

Miro&#8217;s UI means that I can navigate the TED feed simply, start automatic downloads, and show the videos in full-screen glory &#8212; making the experience much more pleasant than what YouTube.

Miro&#8217;s not perfect. My current gripe list is:

  * it&#8217;s too modal &#8212; I&#8217;d like to be able to do feed management at the same time as I&#8217;m watching a video,
  * it&#8217;s not obvious how to get a link to the currently playing video without stopping it, and
  * I want integration with my bookmarking system, not have to use videobomb.

But those are all surface problems. It&#8217;s still a significant step in letting people decide what to watch, facilitate the watching of great content, and dare to consider TV as a non-commercially motivated endeavor.
