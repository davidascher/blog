Forgot to mention that I&#8217;ll be in Berlin Friday, and Hamburg Saturday-Tuesday, for the Calendar project face-to-face, along with Dan Mosedale, Bryan Clark, Mark Banner, and a bunch of the Calendar contributors. It should be a great meeting where we iron out a lot of the roadmap for Lightning/Thunderbird collaboration and integration.
