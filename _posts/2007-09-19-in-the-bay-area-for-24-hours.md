I&#8217;m in the bay area for 24 hours, just long enough to meet the folks at mozilla headquarters, have a few meetings, and participate in what should be an interesting new experience: a live interview with Mitchell Baker and [Asa Dotzler](http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/asa/) on [Air Mozilla](http://air.mozilla.com/), mozilla&#8217;s internet video outlet. In the future, I&#8217;ll try and make my visits longer and mention them earlier, so that I can schedule a broader range of conversations, be they in offices, homes, or organic fair trade coffee shops! It&#8217;s clear from the state of my inboxen* and the comments on this blog and Mitchell&#8217;s that _a lot of people_ have opinions and ideas to contribute, ranging from perspectives on the problems to possible solutions to possible business relationships to employment discussions. In the first few hours, I&#8217;ve heard from friends old and new from as far away from home as China, Singapore and even Redmond! This is going to be a fascinating adventure.

*: yes, that&#8217;s an old vax joke which the kids won&#8217;t get, but I&#8217;m tired and punchy, and I get to make 2 email jokes a month now.
