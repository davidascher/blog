It rains in Vancouver.&nbsp; This year, it&#8217;s rained a lot.&nbsp; We have narrowly missed beating a record set in the 1950s for the longest number of days with measurable rain (last Sunday was, frustratingly, clear and blue and gorgeous). Most of the time, the rain doesn&#8217;t bother me, as I live most of the day indoors.&nbsp; Sometimes, it gets depressing.&nbsp; On the plus side, it means that the local ski hills have over 200cm of accumulated snow, with fresh powder added up most days (70cm in the last week alone).&nbsp; That, if you actually make it up the mountain, is very good news.

Last night Emily and I went up early enough to sign up for lessons (it&#8217;s one of the best features of Vancouver that one can go skiing in the evening, &#8220;just like that&#8221;).&nbsp; By luck, as I was the only student in my level, I ended up with a private lesson instead of a group one.&nbsp; I improved more in an hour and a half than I have in the last twenty years (since I haven&#8217;t had a lesson in over twenty years and didn&#8217;t ski for most of those, it&#8217;s not too hard, but I really did improve a lot).&nbsp; My instructor has been teaching for 20+ years, and he simply knew exactly what I was doing wrong (lots), and how to make me improve.&nbsp; And he did it with kindness, encouragement, and good cheer.

This brought to mind two thoughts on education that I have had frequently as I&#8217;ve watched my kids learn (whether they&#8217;re learning math, spelling or soccer): First, that good educators are undervalued.&nbsp; There is something unique and very powerful about one competent teacher helping another that simply can&#8217;t be replaced by self-teaching, books, online anything. It&#8217;d be good to bottle it, but I don&#8217;t think it can be bottled.&nbsp; Second, that I, at least, respond extremely well to positive feedback and very poorly to negative feedback &#8212; it&#8217;s not just that I enjoy myself more when treated well, but I really do work harder and get better.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many of my formative years were spent in an educational system which primarily believed in the latter, which is one reason why it&#8217;s taken me years to sign up for these ski lessons in the first place &#8212; I still expect to be yelled at&#8230;

Note to self: take more lessons.
