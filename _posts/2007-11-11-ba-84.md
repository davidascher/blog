There is no feeling quite like getting ready to board a transatlantic flight booked solid with both the very young and the very old, the very worried and the very infirm, a few hundred humans with varied cultural baggage and sometimes clashing ways of coping with stress. An odd sampling of humanity thrown together at the whim of life&#8217;s accidents and schedules, and who will, by the time we all go our separate ways, know a bit more about each other, for better or worse.
