So I&#8217;m working on a project. It&#8217;s a cool project. It&#8217;s a big project. So far, there are four of us on it. We need more people.

Until we can talk about the product in more detail, a lot of the product info is deliberately fuzzy.

The ambition: To help create a product that a _lot_ of people will love. (more details will be given if you get to the interview)

The role: To work with other engineers and designers, bringing your skills in making web-based user interactions that rival the best desktop applications in ease-of-use and fun-of-use.

The technologies: DHTML, Flash, Ajax, Comet, advanced javascript, other dynamic languages, secret sauce.

The location: Vancouver, BC. Life rocks here.

The environment: a small growing _very collaborative_ team within a company that&#8217;s done some pretty neat things in the world of dynamic languages.

Experience needed: Having shipped a product. Cut code. Cut features. Argued against a feature for the sake of users. Argued against a feature in spite of users. Open source chops are great. Having touched web-based products is great.
