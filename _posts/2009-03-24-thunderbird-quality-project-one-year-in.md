Ludovic [posted](http://quality.mozilla.org/story/one-year-thunderbird-bugdays) on QMO about the results after one year of Thunderbird bug days. The chart is impressive.

Sincere thanks to Gary, Wayne, Ludovic, and everyone else who jumps in to help.

In related news, apparently there&#8217;s a 2-for-1 [sale on bug help](http://quality.mozilla.org/events/2009/mar/26/operation-2-1-celebrating-one-year-thunderbird-bugday-day-1). ðŸ˜‰
