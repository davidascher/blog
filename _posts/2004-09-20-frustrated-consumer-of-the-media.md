Jon Udell correctly [points out](http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/08/18.html#a1062) that I _can_ point to specific bits of the <span class="caps">KMDI</span> archives, unlike what I said in the post [below](http://www.ascher.ca/blog/index.cgi/computing/opensource/kmdi.html) . Until today, I didn&#8217;t know how, and yesterday at 1am, I didn&#8217;t really care to learn. I may do it later to immortalize some of the better bits of the Moglen/McGowan debate. (It doesn&#8217;t help that Jon blogging about it has apparently caused a <span class="caps">DDOS</span> on the poor <span class="caps">KMDI</span> archives!). <span class="caps">FYI</span>, you can avoid steps 1 through 5 in Jon&#8217;s <span class="caps">HOWTO</span> by going to the [page listing the streaming URLs](http://osconf.kmdi.utoronto.ca/stand_alone.htm). Until Jon&#8217;s post, however, I had no idea what to do with those URLs.

I don&#8217;t even remember what I said in that conference about PVRs (Personal Video Recorders). I have since started using a <span class="caps">PVR</span>, and it&#8217;s been a very interesting experiment. It&#8217;s not only changed the way that I (and everyone else in my family) watches TV, but it also makes me want to do things like post excerpts from the Daily Show. Jon says:

> We deploy AV content on the web in a style that emulates television but is antithetical to the web. I&#8217;d like to change that.

I wholeheartedly agree, but also want to push TV to be more web-compatible.

Right now I can point people to books I like (see below), I can point people to music, but for TV, the best I can do is say things like &#8220;I really enjoyed Maureen Dowd&#8217;s appearance on the Daily Show with John Stewart&#8221;, and some readers will relate, some will feel they missed out, a tiny fraction will seek out a bittorrent of the show, but the vast majority simply won&#8217;t be able to watch that episode. What shame. I wonder what it would take to get Jon Stewart to publish through the web.
