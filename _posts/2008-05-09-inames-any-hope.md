So I have this nice short iname that I registered last year when I was poking around OpenID and the like. That registration is about to expire, and I think I have yet to use it except for testing purposes, in part because there&#8217;s no way when being asked for an OpenID to know whether the server supports inames or not. In addition to being just shorter hence cooler, I can&#8217;t even remember the benefits of inames over traditional URLs. I guess I&#8217;ll let it lapse&#8230;

Somebody fix identity. Please?
