AppleScript, Shrook & Pukka experts &#8212; is it possible to build a custom keyboard command that lets me invoke Pukka from Shrook? (These names, I know!).

I haven&#8217;t touched AppleScript seriously since the late 80s I fear, but there&#8217;s got to be a way to hijack Pukka&#8217;s Mark as Flagged command, no?
