One of the goals for Thunderbird 3 is to be a much better platform for which to develop add-ons.

We&#8217;re planning and doing some in-product and in-codebase work to that end, including documenting APIs (shocking, I know), bundling [STEEL](http://wiki.mozilla.org/User:Jminta/Steel), which should make it easy to do 80% of what add-on authors want to do without resorting to XPCOM voodoo, and in general refactoring to make more capabilities pluggable.

But I&#8217;d like to find out what else we can do. Are there enough ways for add-on developers to get help? Do you know where to ask for various kinds of questions? Add a comment if you have ideas, please.

I&#8217;ve been emailing with David Boswell and Eric Jung from [mozdev](http://www.mozdev.org/), trying to figure out if there&#8217;s something the two organizations can do together, as we have some natural overlap in this area.

Ideas welcome!
