I&#8217;m back from Romania, where I had the pleasure of participating in the second annual [eLiberatica](http://eliberatica.ro/2008/) conference, on open source, organized by [Lucian Savluc](http://www.cianblog.com/), a fellow Vancouverite, with organizational support from [ROSI](http://rosi.ro/), and with [Zak&#8217;s](http://zak.greant.com/) assistance.

It was a lot of fun, as well as a highly energizing event (which is hard when the base condition is one of severe jetlag compounded by not enough sleep).

My slides are [now available](http://ascher.ca/presentations/eliberatica2008.pdf), although you don&#8217;t get to appreciate all of the fancy animations that Keynote does (note to the OpenOffice.org folks: make the animations really sexy, and I&#8217;ll switch. I&#8217;m a sucker for pizzazz.).

I have a bunch of thoughts that I want to blog as a result of my trip, but as usual, finding the time to organize them into a coherent post is the challenging bit.

Executive summary:

  * eLiberatica was great, look forward to seeing how it evolves
  * Traveling to foreign lands with hosts such as Lucian and his friends is _definitely_ the way to travel
  * Travel and the subsequent impact on relationships is incredibly important to the long term success of open source, and of Mozilla. We have to make it easier, more decentralized, and less guilt-inducing
  * I want to travel more. I want to travel less.
  * Romania is changing incredibly fast. There are lots of opportunities, and decisions which will have significant impact are being made there every day
  * Zak&#8217;s network includes really interesting, thoughtful folks.
  * The world is incredibly small, and yet very big
  * If they&#8217;ll honest about it, everyone likes dancing to hits of the eighties.
