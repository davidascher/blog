Let&#8217;s see&#8230; in the last few weeks, we have seen:

Facebook shifting the definition of the Open Graph and moving the locus of control about sharing from an actual user-initiated action (&#8220;share!&#8221;) to the terms of service [that users agree to at &#8220;app installation time&#8221;](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/read_in_facebook_social_news_apps.php). This will likely lead users to overshare, and many more websites to [require facebook accounts](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/27/zuckerberg_reservation_and_the_future_of_content_platforms/).

Amazon building a [new way](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_rel_topic?ie=UTF8&nodeId=200775440) of using the web which many [fear](http://cdespinosa.posterous.com/fire) will be a data mining engine that &#8220;acts on your behalf&#8221; as you do anything on the web, not just with Amazon sites. Until now, only regulated ISPs or government agencies had that level of access to our online activities.

Microsoft preparing a version of Windows which will demote third-party browsers and bake in support for a single-vendor [appstore](http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2011/09/build-2011-first-details-on-th.php).

Google [aggressively promoting](http://gizmodo.com/5816448/googles-new-home-page-pushes-you-to-plus) their mostly closed social network on all of its properties.

(All of whom are basically following Apple&#8217;s lead on how to verticalize the world).

The threat models are fascinating too. According to the blogosphere, Facebook is feeling threatened by users shifting to mobile (read: iPhone); Google&#8217;s threatened by Facebook; Apple needs to figure out social; Everyone&#8217;s going to get bit by patents, but they all have huge cash reserves to apply to that problem.

This industry is heading in a direction that is sure to be full of fireworks, but I&#8217;m having a hard time seeing how normal people end up winning at the end.

If these trends continue, in a few years at most we&#8217;ll basically choose one of 3 or 4 vertical stacks to work in. Rich people will be able to afford to play in all of them (an iOS macphone, an android tablet, a kindle Plasma, a facebook TV, etc.).

Consumption will go up, free access will be contingent on actual consumption. Kindle people will have a heck of a time communicating with Apple people. Facebookers will make fun of Googlers. App developers will slowly realize that they&#8217;re the outsourced R&D department for the big 5, and success will be defined as being acquired for a few bucks rather than creating jobs or making the world a better place.

Consumers are part of the problem too, of course &#8212; we like simple, shiny, integrated solutions. We want freedom from choice more than we actually value choice.

The next generation will likely think of our notions of privacy, autonomy, and various freedoms as quaint or foolish, much like we look on our parents&#8217; notions of decorum and modesty. Either that, or they&#8217;ll unplug and start to riot, because of the co-occuring global economic climate which, to put it bluntly, will suck for people who don&#8217;t have stock in said 5 companies.

So, that&#8217;s a pretty bleak assessment, and it tends to depress me. What&#8217;s the silver lining? I don&#8217;t have a very rosy picture yet, although I&#8217;m _trying!_ I have a few proto-thoughts:

First, those five companies, while very impressive and influential, represent a tiny fraction of the creative, intellectual and even financial resources of the world. Furthermore, those companies are all US-based, which simply isn&#8217;t a stable configuration. So while those companies are defining extremely aggressive winner-take-all strategies, and executing for the most part exceedingly well, we should realize that there are way more of &#8220;us&#8221; than &#8220;them&#8221;.

Second, these companies all have competitors, and I expect always will. Even if there were no other market forces at play, these five will keep beating each other up forever. Mergers of giants might even be a good thing, given that those tend to destroy focus and operational excellence.

Third, I think that there is a growing shared understanding of what&#8217;s wrong with these trends from a public policy point of view. The internet, the web, were not intended to facilitate these empires, and I expect that over time, as John Gilmore said, &#8220;The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.&#8221; So somehow, we&#8217;ll figure out a way to take the bits of net life that truly matter, and extract those from the silos being built.

There are many projects in this general vein already under way, some with significant involvement from Mozilla. For example, we&#8217;re pushing hard on federating identity on the web, and teaching the web about apps and vice versa. I&#8217;m hopeful that we&#8217;ll also find ways to recognize friends and partners along the way. I&#8217;ve got a list in my head, but it&#8217;s probably worth building it out. If you have pointers to projects that touch on these issues, let me know in comments.
