I&#8217;ve liked ampersands for a long time (probably since I started paying attention to type). That&#8217;s the motivation for the new graphic that shows up in the masthead (which won&#8217;t look anything close to good if you don&#8217;t have the right fonts installed, but I&#8217;m trying to maintain quick download times). As an aside &#8212; I use [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox), and while I try to make sure the site is readable with at least IE, I won&#8217;t know if the site is illegible with other browsers.

Adobe provides a [nice history of the ampersand](http://store.adobe.com/type/topics/theampersand.html) with some nice examples as well (look especially at the variation within the Poetica typeface!).

While on the topic, people who care about typesetting and typography have (naturally) a lot of nice books to read, but my current favorite is [The Elements of Typographic Style](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0881791326), by Robert Bringhurst. A pleasure to read if you are easily annoyed by bad kerning, pleased by beautiful font design, etc. It&#8217;s the typographic equivalent of [Eats, Shoots & Leaves](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1592400876/qid=1098902862), but unfortunately is not selling as well! Thanks to Thanassi for getting me to read TETS.
