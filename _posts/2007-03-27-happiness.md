Just heard [Jane McGonigal&#8217;s](http://avantgame.blogspot.com/) talk about happiness. I really, _really_ like her prediction for the future (quick notes, not verbatim):

  * quality of life is the primary metric
  * positive psychology is a principal influence on design
  * the public expects tech companies to have a clear vision for a life worth living
  * to succeed, products/brands/etc. must increase real happiness &#8211; the new capital

So refreshing. And the games she&#8217;s designed are truly hopeful.
