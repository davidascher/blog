One more update on my interactions with the Sun developer hardware program (for history, see [this](http://ascher.ca/blog/2006/01/24/grr-sun-microsystems-and-customer-self-service-or-lack-thereof/) and [this](http://ascher.ca/blog/2006/01/25/developer-promotion-sun-part-ii/)).

Today, I got a couple of emails from the program owner for the development hardware offering, who quickly helped me understand that the situation is better than I thought.&nbsp; Specifically, I misunderstood the web content, which says:

> Deep discounts on development hardware are available to you! For  
> additional information please contact your Primary Contact.

My reading of that was that I should talk to our primary contact at Sun.&nbsp; What was intended was that I should talk to Sun&#8217;s primary contact within our company.&nbsp; Much better.

In other words, while it would be good for me to see the price list, all I _need_ is for someone within my organization to get the data, which I can.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also just fixable with a rewrite of a sentence, and I&#8217;m quite hopeful that Sun will, as they&#8217;ve promised, will fix this (admittedly fairly trivial) buglet.
