Change is hard. I spend a lot of time trying to enable, encourage, foster, stimulate, provoke, change in software.

Part of that is because it feels like it&#8217;s that most plastic of human endeavors. That, of course, is only true to the extent that the people involved in the creation of software \_are\_ plastic.

One of the fascinating things in the last few months is that it feels that, with the Obama administration, people are thinking big about societal change, in a variety of contexts.

The latest one to cross my twitter stream is Carl Malamud&#8217;s bid for the government printing office, which is full of great, big ideas. So cool.

Read up about it: <http://yeswescan.org/>, and follow the links to the proposals & the videos. They&#8217;re quite compelling, optimistic, ambitious, and, I&#8217;m sure, threatening to the status quo. At the very least, it&#8217;s a great conversation.

Godspeed, Carl.
