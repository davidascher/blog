I mentioned last year that I&#8217;d donated to the Creative Commons fundraiser.&nbsp; Another fundraiser that&#8217;s gotten press is the Wikipedia fundraiser.&nbsp; It&#8217;s interesting to see that both drives were quite successful.&nbsp; Wikipedia raises about [$30k/day](http://fundraising.wikimedia.org/ongoing/index.php/2006-01/) this month, and Creative Commons exceeded their goals by 50%, including a $25k gift from microsoft and a very interesting [$1M anonymous donation](http://creativecommons.org/support/)!&nbsp; 

Both of those organizations/projects are based on optimistic beliefs about human nature.&nbsp; It&#8217;s nice to see that they are rewarded.
