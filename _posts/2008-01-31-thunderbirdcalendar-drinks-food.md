After a long day of talking about calendaring at CalConnect, some of the Mozilla calendar & mail folks (hopefully at least Daniel, Christian, Dan, Clint and David) will be going out for drinks & more food on <strike>Tuesday Feb 5</strike> Wednesday, Feb 6, starting around 8pm or so at the Oasis beer garden. Please sign up for the [event](http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/421054/?ps=5) if you&#8217;re thinking of going, and we&#8217;ll try to save you a seat.
