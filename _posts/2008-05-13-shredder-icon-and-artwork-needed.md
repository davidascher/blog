If you ever used a Firefox alpha or a nightly build, you know it&#8217;s called Minefield. As [I&#8217;ve explained](http://ascher.ca/blog/2008/05/03/naming-alphas/), we&#8217;re going to do the same for Thunderbird, using the name &#8220;Shredder&#8221;. Now we need some artwork!

First order of business when I grew up would be the t-shirt design, but in this day an age figuring out the icon set is the more environmental approach. Submissions should be sent to me, or ideally, attached to [this bug](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=433630).

For background, see the [minefield icon](http://mxr.mozilla.org/firefox/source/browser/app/mozicon128.png), and the current [Thunderbird Debug ICNS file](http://mxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/mail/app/macbuild/thunderbird.icns), which while pretty, has nothing to do with sharp blades whirring.
