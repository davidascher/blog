Something else I&#8217;ve had on my blogging queue for a while:

Last month, when we had the Calendar meeting in Hamburg, we met with some of the OpenOffice.org and Sun engineers. One idea that came up that I intended to mention here is that OpenOffice.org has a [Community Innovation Program](http://development.openoffice.org/community_innovation_program.html), funded by Sun Microsystems, which includes cash prizes for cool projects. A project which somehow made Thunderbird and OpenOffice.org work better together would be eligible, as much as I understand the rules. So put your thinking cap on and apply!

Possible ideas:

  * An ODF reader for Thunderbird?
  * Some sort of mail merge feature?

Other ideas?
