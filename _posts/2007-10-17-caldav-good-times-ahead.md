While I wasn&#8217;t looking, a bunch of people have been making real progress in standards-based calendaring interop. I&#8217;ve been talking to a few of them, and it&#8217;s fascinating to see momentum building in that arena. There are clients getting mature (Thunderbird with Lightning, Apple&#8217;s iCal in Leopard, Chandler Desktop, Evolution, probably others I&#8217;m forgetting or don&#8217;t know about). There are servers getting there too (Chandler&#8217;s server, Apple&#8217;s CalendarServer, Bongo, a couple that I know about but don&#8217;t know if I can talk about publicly yet). As far as I can tell, the CalConnect consortium is working, making sure that people play the interop game, even though I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s hard work. It would be nice if Google wasn&#8217;t so far out in left field, but you can&#8217;t have everything.

Nothing like being minority players to get competitors to cooperate on pushing a standard forward!
