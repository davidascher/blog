I&#8217;ve upgraded the software I use for blog-reading & writing. I&#8217;m pretty happy with the following so far:

  * I&#8217;ve switched to [Shrook](http://www.utsire.com/shrook/) as my aggregator. It&#8217;s the only one I found that could let me quickly reorganize my 300+ RSS feeds into groups. Key word being &#8220;quickly&#8221;. Most of the others I tried didn&#8217;t scale well from a UI point of view (Google Reader and Bloglines in particular). It has groups which can overlap (&#8220;Favorites&#8221; and &#8220;Inspiring&#8221; can both contain the same feed), and it has some sort of bayesian learning thing which I haven&#8217;t figured out yet. It also has a web-based online reading & synchronizing service, which I haven&#8217;t poked at either. 
  * I&#8217;ve upgraded to [MarsEdit](http://www.red-sweater.com/marsedit/) 2.0 (well, haven&#8217;t paid yet but I will). I&#8217;m not sure why. 
  * After figuring out the category support in MarsEdit, I upgraded [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) to 2.2.3. Nothing broke as far as I can tell. 

The other piece of software I&#8217;m enjoying these days is [HiveMinder](http://hiveminder.com/), after a recommendation from [Zak](http://zak.greant.com/). It&#8217;s related to RT, but it fits my brain much better than RT did. I particularly like the Instant Messaging interface. More on that later if I get around to it&#8230;
