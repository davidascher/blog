I&#8217;d like to make a quicksilver script to connect [Pukka](http://codesorcery.net/pukka) and Firefox. If anyone&#8217;s done it already, send it my way!

Alternatively, if I could just add a keyboard shortcut to the bookmarklet&#8230;

UPDATE: Justin Miller pointed me out-of-band to [this page](http://codesorcery.net/2006/06/14/pukka-and-applescript/), which includes an applescript which can be configured with quicksilver to be hot-keyed. Unfortunately, that loses the title for the page, so while it is more keyboard-driven than the bookmarklet, the requirement to type in a title makes it not as convenient. Automation is hard!
