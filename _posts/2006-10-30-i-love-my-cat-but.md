Sometime during the night of Saturday to Sunday my lovely cat Syd took out her fears of aging on my keyboard, and ripped out a half-dozen keys from my powerbook keyboard, left open on the dining room table. She&#8217;s lucky that I&#8217;d already killed on key earlier by dropping a phone handset on it, or she&#8217;d be in serious trouble.
