I&#8217;m trying to get the Gmail mobile app to work on my BenQ-Siemens EF81. I have a Fido account with a GPRS plan.

I can get to the web using the built-in browser by setting up a &#8220;Connectivity Profile&#8221; that points to wap.fido.ca, and creating a &#8220;Internet Profile&#8221; that specifies a proxy address of 172.25.0.107 (from [here](http://www.ehmac.ca/ipod-itunes-iphone-apple-tv/55329-edge-networking-not-working.html)). However, gmail doesn&#8217;t work then (gets stuck on &#8220;Loading&#8230;&#8221;).

I&#8217;m thinking it&#8217;s because I should be using a direct GPRS connection instead of WAP (whatever that means in practice), as [Google suggests](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=52876&topic=10070).

Any idea how to do so?

I hate technology that makes me feel stupid, and this phone UI, combined with the acronym soup that is telecom, makes me feel stupid.
