Cal Henderson, from [flickr](http://www.flickr.com), at the [PHPWest](http://www.phpwest.com) conference:

> &#8220;Avoid code reuse (_just a nice typo_)&#8221;

and, talking about [phpxpath](http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpxpath/):

> &#8220;phpxpath is great. It&#8217;s on Sourceforge, but it&#8217;s still great&#8221;

and about UTF8:

> &#8220;Can&#8217;t remember what UTF-8 stands for. Something something something eight!&#8221;

a bit that made Rasmus and me feel old:

> &#8220;I think UUencode stands for unix to unix encode &#8212; it&#8217;s pretty old&#8221; (_it&#8217;s true, but &#8230;_)

About users:

> &#8220;We have a lot of Mac users, because OS X users tend to be early adopters and have a lot of free time&#8221;

And then, when Cal said that PHP isn&#8217;t great for a daemon, Rasmus&#8217; answer was:

> &#8220;Write it in C, you sissy!&#8221;

Overall, a nice, contentful presentation from the guy responsible for the PHP (and, it appears, a lot of the DB work) code behind flickr, with good lessons learned on how to scale a web app to accomodate massive growth. I look forward to the [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) presentation.
