I&#8217;ve spent a few hours re-dunking my head in the [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) soup. That is one impressive open source project. Apart from the immediately appealing superficial qualities (great name, beautiful CSS), it has truly stellar documentation, that shows (or at least seems to show!) that the people who designed it really knew what they were doing. A real pleasure. I&#8217;m looking forward to playing with it. It feels like opening up an iPod box and admiring the packaging, design, button layout. I just need to get some tunes onto it now!
