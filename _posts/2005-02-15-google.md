It just dawned on me. I want Google to do an online calendaring system. Yeah, it won&#8217;t solve 95% of my scheduling problems because it won&#8217;t have access to behind-the-firewall data and it won&#8217;t do the collaboration part of scheduling, but at the least it&#8217;ll have a more usable UI than what I&#8217;m working with now, and it&#8217;ll have some sort of export to standard formats like iCal that will let me fool myself into thinking that the end is near&#8230;
