Back from a trip to Berkeley, San Francisco (in part for Web 2.0, which was, as many have remarked, full of suits) and Paris, for my brother&#8217;s two weddings. As much as I have fond memories of my own weddings, it&#8217;s nice to not have to worry about anything and just be able to enjoy things. It was also nice to have our first kid-free multi-day vacation in over 8 years (well, since there were kids to be kid-free from).

Now we&#8217;re back, it&#8217;s raining, the teachers are on strike, but at least the car repairs were more minimal than expected.

Next planned trip: two days in Ottawa at the end of the month. I&#8217;ve never been outside the airport &#8212; I hope I get to see at least a bit of the city while I&#8217;m there, but it&#8217;s doubtful (full two days of meetings, I think).
