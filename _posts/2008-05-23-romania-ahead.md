I&#8217;ll be heading out to Romania next week, to talk in Bucharest at [eLiberatica](http://eliberatica.ro/2008/) about Mozilla and open source, and to learn about everything from open source in eastern Europe to food (always). I&#8217;ll also be visiting my grandfather&#8217;s hometown (Bra≈üov) for a bit of personal root-digging. Should be fun, especially if I get rid of this grogging (new word!) cold I&#8217;ve just picked up.

As a side note: it&#8217;s interesting to see that an open source conference is now sponsored by everyone from the FSF Europe to Microsoft. What is the world coming to?
