Via today&#8217;s nytimes.com (do continuously updated websites have &#8220;today&#8221; editions), there&#8217;s [the AP story on the government asking Google for some data](http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/technology/AP-Google-Records.html?hp&ex=1137733200&en=d4b7e16622a81f6f&ei=5094&partner=homepage), including:

> a request for 1 million random Web addresses and records of all Google searches from any one-week period [&#8230;, and sic: &#8220;random web addresses?&#8221;]

which the DOJ says it needs to 

> determine how often pornography shows up in online searches as part of an effort to revive an Internet child protection law [&#8230;]

What I wonder is why the government didn&#8217;t just ask for the aggregate statistic directly.&nbsp; After all, Google publishes [statistics](http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html) all the time on aggregate data (and those are depressing statistics, btw).&nbsp; They must have a methodology in mind for what they would do with the data, which presumably doesn&#8217;t involve [Potter Stewart](http://www.bartleby.com/63/93/1793.html) looking at a million web pages to do, so they could just ask Google.

It doesn&#8217;t do anything to address the privacy concerns with Google having that data, but it does address the privacy concerns of the DOJ having data on private citizens (although it&#8217;s hard to tell from the AP story whether any private data would actually be disclosed in the subpoena).
