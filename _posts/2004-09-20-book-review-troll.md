A Finnish book by Johanna Sinisalo, translated by Herbert Lomas,  
set in contemporary Finland. Trolls, long believed to be mythical  
creatures, have been documented since the beginning of the twentieth  
century. The lead character (not so much a hero) rescues one from some thugs,  
and adopts it as a pet.

A strange but interesting book, definitely out of the ordinary. It&apos;s  
a bit hard to describe it without spoiling some of the key bits. Suffice  
it to say that it&apos;s somewhat of a love story, somewhat of a modern take  
on lust, and somewhat of a story about urban life clashing with nature in  
its rawest (even mythological) form.
