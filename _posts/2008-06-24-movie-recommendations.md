Based on [Simon](http://simonwex.com/)&#8216;s recommendation (he&#8217;s quite reliable), I squeezed [Elling](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elling) in the kids&#8217; Zip.ca subscription. I highly recommend it. It&#8217;s a peaceful, thoughtful, grownup movie, about a couple of slightly odd Norwegian men trying to figure out life. Don&#8217;t even bother looking at the imdb.com page, it&#8217;s worse than misleading. Just watch it.

Other recommendations while we&#8217;re at it:

  * [Unser t√§glich Brot](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0765849/) (Our Daily Bread), a fascinating piece about industrial food production, without words, and yet quite compelling.
  * Another Simon rec: [Manda Bala (Send a bullet)](http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0912590/), a depressing but fascinating movie about the impact of kidnappings in Sao Paolo,
  * [Le scaphandre et le papillon (The Diving Bell and the Butterfly)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0401383/), a true story about a successful french editor who has a stroke and ends up with &#8220;locked-in syndrome&#8221;, and can only communicate by blinking. Surprisingly not as depressing as you&#8217;d think.
  * In the lighter-weight entertainment category, I enjoyed [Next](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0435705/), as an action/time-travel Nicholas Cage vehicle.
