I&#8217;m looking to change my VISA card, as the current one gives us points towards &#8216;stuff&#8217;, most of which I don&#8217;t need. I&#8217;d be more interested in cards that either served some sort of purpose (e.g. the VanCity cards) or points that are more useful, such as high-leverage travel frequent flyer miles on either flights to the US or to Europe.

Any recommendations?
