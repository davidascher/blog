I was quite interested in seeing what the Fotango team was working on with their Zimki server-side JavaScript system. Unfortunately, from what the grapevine says, their parent company wasn&#8217;t so interested. In the mail today:

> We regret to inform you that the Zimki service is to be withdrawn and therefore will no longer be available from 24 December 2007. We would like to apologise for any inconvenience that this may cause.
> 
> One of the first things that will be disabled is the token usage section so unfortunately you will be unable to view your realms&#8217; usage (code, bandwidth, storage etc.). You will still be able to create and manage your realms, and realms will not be suspended for exceeding usage restrictions during the close down period.
> 
> As of 24 December 2007 all applications and data remaining on the Zimki service will be deleted and the servers decommissioned. Users are advised to move their applications along with any associated data before the closure date. There are no plans to opensource Zimki.
> 
> We hope that Zimki has helped to increase your knowledge and understanding of the possibilities that utility computing and an online application framework can bring. We would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for your interest and support with beta testing the Zimki service. 

The penultimate paragraph is funny, as AFAIK there&#8217;s no way to move the code, since it requires the Zimki platform, which they had promised would be open-sourced. Ah well.
