One of the nice things about taking a day off is that it really _does_  
help clear the mind. And it gives one the energy to tackle painful problems, like:

> Why is the tv-out signal not working since I cleaned up the mess-o-cables in the back of the new PVR? 

even in the face of painful recent history involving:

  * reinstalling drivers
  * messing around with control panel configurations for hours
  * rebooting n times
  * getting depressed at the complexity of things that should be simple

So I figured I&apos;d try something silly like plug the video card in  
another PCI slot, &#8220;just for fun&#8221;. At which point I realized that I&apos;d  
plugged the cable going to the RF converter into the video  
_capture_ card, not the video _out_ card. Sigh.
