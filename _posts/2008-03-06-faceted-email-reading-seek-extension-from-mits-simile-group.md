As a sinner but devout follower of the [Church of Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/) and general fan of information display and the like, I&#8217;ve been following the work of the [Simile](http://simile.mit.edu/) group at MIT for a while. Their [Exhibit](http://simile.mit.edu/exhibit/) and [Timeline](http://simile.mit.edu/timeline/) projects are really interesting takes on complex visualization problems, well done.

Meet the latest work product from that group, [Seek](http://simile.mit.edu/seek/). Seek is a Thunderbird 2 extension (doesn&#8217;t work without modification on trunk nightlies yet) from [David Fran√ßois Huynh](http://people.csail.mit.edu/dfhuynh/) to do faceted email browsing. It even includes a timeline visualization component. Check out the screencast, or just install the extension to give it a shot and play with it. This is experimental, early stage work, but I think it&#8217;s superb &#8212; it should I think spark all kinds of great discussions as to new ways of mining this incredibly rich data store we call email archives.
