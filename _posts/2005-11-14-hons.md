People usually refer to Vancouver as a really good place for high-end Chinese food. I wouldn&#8217;t know, as our taste are more pedestrian. For future reference, last night&#8217;s order at [Hon&#8217;s](http://www.shinnova.com/hons_on_robson/) was the best we&#8217;ve achieved so far:

  * 6 pork pan-fried gyoza
  * springrolls (mistake, no one ate them)
  * tender duck leg soup with orange peel and udon noodles (yummy duck!)
  * spicy braised eggplant with pork (my favorite chinese food)
  * Beef with ginger and green onions (tender beef, if not plentiful enough)
  * Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce (gotta have some greens)

All that was quite nice after our first skiing day.
