One of the things I love about downtown vancouver is the abundance of good, cheap eateries. I&#8217;ve grown quite averse to large chains (too much subversive reading, I guess), so I&#8217;m pleased to see thriving neighborhood places that offer good food at good prices.

Now that it&#8217;s been in the paper, Caffe Artigiano on West Hastings is hardly a &#8220;find&#8221;, but it&#8217;s still a source of very high quality food. The only thing that I don&#8217;t like there is their hot chocolate. Everything else is good or very good.

Nuba is a lebanese hole-in-the-wall on West Hastings with a funky atmosphere, great basic middle-eastern food (the lamb plate is my favorite), and _the best baklava I&#8217;ve ever tasted_. Absolutely stunning, imported from Detroit and Montreal. I enjoy the turkish coffee as well, although it pays to be moderate with it.

A block from Nuba, still on Hastings, is Tacos Mexico Delicioso, the best &#8220;working-class&#8221; mexican restaurant in the city. Basic mexican food, done right. My favorite: the Sopes con Chorizo.

A block away, on Pender, is my latest find: Finch&#8217;s coffeehouse, which specializes in baguette sandwiches and salads. The owner, English and of &#8220;restaurant background&#8221;, couldn&#8217;t resist opening up the place when he saw the space was available. The menu varies with the availability of ingredients. I&#8217;ve been there 6 times or so, and I&#8217;m quite pleased. My egg salad sandwich was particularly good, thanks to first-grade ingredients. The somewhat weird thing about the place is that apart from the owner (who hasn&#8217;t been visible the last few times), I tend to be the only male in the place.

Across the street from Finch&#8217;s is Cassis, definitely higher-end fancy-lunch place, including crepes, pizzas with truffle oil, fancy deserts etc. I wasn&#8217;t thrilled by the pizza I had (the crust was way too &#8220;healthy&#8221; and un-Neapolitan for my taste), but I&#8217;ll try it again. It seems quite popular, and I must hope it&#8217;s not just because it looks hip.
