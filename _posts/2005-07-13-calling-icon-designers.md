[ActiveState](http://www.ActiveState.com) is looking for a contractor to do a bunch of icon design work (primarily the icons that are used within [Komodo](http://activestate.com/Products/Komodo/?_x=1)). Contact me if you know someone who understands within-application icon design (as opposed to &#8220;branding&#8221; icons, these icons are primarily usability-driven).

We&#8217;re flexible when it comes to all kinds of things, but we need someone who can start pretty soon.

Preference will be given to people who understand the world of programming, as the users are all programmers and many icons refer to programming concepts.
