[Corante](http://www.corante.com/) is an interesting collection of blogs. Unfortunately, it renders so slowly in Firefox that I basically can&#8217;t stand reading it. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s Firefox&#8217;s problem (IE seems to do ok), but in the meantime it&#8217;d be nice if the Corante folks fixed it (yes, I mailed a comment in)&#8230;
