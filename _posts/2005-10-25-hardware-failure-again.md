Last week, the motherboard on my trusty and much-lugged Dell laptop was replaced to fix the power management problems. Today, the hard drive died an ugly-sounding death. I have no idea what data I lost, but it can&#8217;t be too much: my email is all stored on servers, my bookmarks are stored on delicious, my photos are on flickr, my code is in source code repositories, and my presentations are stored in my email.

Other interesting bit: I&#8217;ll probably get a replacement hard disk tomorrow, but as I&#8217;m leaving on a trip in the afternoon I&#8217;ll have time to install Linux but not Windows. OS choice driven by schedule. It&#8217;ll be an interesting plane trip, I&#8217;m sure.
