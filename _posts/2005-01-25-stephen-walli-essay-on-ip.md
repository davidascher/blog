[Stephen Walli](http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/), who I have enjoyable chats with at conferences periodically, has a new [blog](http://stephesblog.blogs.com/my_weblog/2005/01/when_are_you_go.html), with a very cogent [essay](http://stephesblog.blogs.com/essays/CustomersIP.html) on intellectual property, business practices and open source. A nice way to start a blog.
