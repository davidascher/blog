T&#8217;was fun. Not as beautiful weather as in this great shot by fellow Flickrite and Vancouverite &#8220;seawallrunner&#8221;, but nice nonetheless.

Since last season, both Hugo and Sylvia have become fearless and have decided to enjoy skiing. No actual change in skill, just a different mental state, and all of a sudden they&#8217;re singing down the slopes, not whimpering.

It took me until I was 17 or so, and they&#8217;re doing it at age 5 and 8. Not bad.
