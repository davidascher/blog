In a new-thing-for-me, I&#8217;m working with a group of four students from the Center for Digital Media as part of their Masters program, on a design-led project that ties to Mozilla.  Specifically, [these folks](http://blogs.gnwc.ca/Cucumber/the-team/) are working on a project they call The Cucumber, which is (in my words), trying to make a tool that lets any traveler easily create a compelling micro-documentary about a place they like, using the tools of the open web.

At this point, they&#8217;ve done a bunch of thinking, blackboard sketches, paper prototypes, and more, and they&#8217;re making good progress, but _they need your help_!  In particular, they&#8217;ve got a hypothesis that by preparing a few templates and story-telling concepts, they can define a design framework that everyone could use to make something compelling.

If you&#8217;re interested, it&#8217;d be great if you could check out their [questionnaire](http://blogs.gnwc.ca/Cucumber/2012/06/15/tell-your-story-and-test-our-recipe/) and do a &#8220;pretend story-telling&#8221; &#8212; think of a place you want to document, and fill in [the form](http://blogs.gnwc.ca/Cucumber/2012/06/15/tell-your-story-and-test-our-recipe/) &#8212; it will only take a few minutes, and be very helpful to the team!
