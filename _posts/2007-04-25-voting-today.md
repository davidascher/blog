Fascinating to see who [other French people living in Vancouver and Calgary voted for](http://www.consulfrance-vancouver.org/organisation_promotion/une/archives_2007/resultat_1er_tour.html?id_article=1771). 12.1% for Jose Bove. And it&#8217;s stats on 1001 votes, so Arlette Laguiller got .3 votes, and three others shared sub-unitary votes. Hmm&#8230;
