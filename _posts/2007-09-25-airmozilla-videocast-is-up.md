I hate hearing myself on an answering machine, and I \_really\_ hate watching myself on video. But, hey, that&#8217;s life in the fast lane. The &#8220;videocast&#8221; of my AIr Mozilla interview and Q&A from last week is [up already](http://airmozilla-videocast.podomatic.com/entry/2007-09-24T09_23_37-07_00). Thanks to Asa Dotzler, Rainer Cvillink, Marcia Knous, Carsten Book and Seth Bindernagel for putting on that show.
