My blog spam problem has decreased since adding a captcha (i.e. &#8220;type this fuzzy text&#8221;). These two, however, showed up, which probably means they were entered by hand.

The first advises the reader to buy some drugs cheap, and then _apologizes!_.

The second is a clone of a previously approved comment on my blog, but using URLs to refer to another doubtful site. 

Sign that once again, both brainpower and ethics are being wasted on a routine basis.
