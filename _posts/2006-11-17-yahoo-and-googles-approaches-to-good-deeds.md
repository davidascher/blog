Google has [Google.org](http://google.org/), which has a billion dollars of seed money and little goals like literacy, clean water, eradicating poverty and other small projects.

Yahoo! has (as far as I can tell) &#8220;[Yahoo! for good](http://brand.yahoo.com/forgood)&#8220;, which is a web site where they can elicit UGC (user-generated content) showing how their users are doing good. Most impressively, Yahoo! for good is on the &#8220;brand.yahoo.com&#8221; website. Ugh.

(ActiveState has neither, true, but&#8230;).
