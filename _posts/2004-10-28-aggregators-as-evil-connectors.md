Scary. I setup this blog in &#8216;stealth&#8217; mode while I was tweaking it, and the default configuration of wordpress involves pinging pingomatic, which is a Good Thing, as it&#8217;s best-practices, etc. However, what it meant was that I got comment spam (luckily auto-moderated by the filter I configured easily) within 24 hours of setting it up, before the site was even decloaked. Scary. Still, I&#8217;m glad I have _some_ spam filtering going on.
