An open-source project that I pay a bit of attention to is SOGo, aka &#8220;scalable OGo&#8221;. It&#8217;s a project w/ a long history, much of which I don&#8217;t know well, but what&#8217;s interesting to me is that they&#8217;re trying to be the Yin to Thunderbird&#8217;s Yang. SOGo includes a web frontend, which is designed to look like Thunderbird, which is a fascinating choice.

The folks at Inverse, who are the primary drivers of SOGo, as far as I know, are also doing Thunderbird & Lightning add-ons ([SOGo Connector and SOGo Integrator](http://www.scalableogo.org/english/about/overview.html)), including adding support for CardDAV, Free/Busy, etc. They&#8217;re also helping with patches to Lightning, for which we&#8217;re definitely grateful!

SOGo reached the 1.0 milestone yesterday, which is always worth celebrating. If you&#8217;re interested in the groupware space and looking at software that plays well w/ thunderbird, [check it out](http://www.scalableogo.org/).
