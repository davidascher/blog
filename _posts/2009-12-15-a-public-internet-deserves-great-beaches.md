Firefox releases have cool codenames while in gestation. As Chelsea [explains](http://chelseanovak.wordpress.com/2009/12/02/save-the-web-save-a-lemur/), Firefox picks national parks as codenames, as metaphors for the values that go into making a Firefox release.

The idea made a lot of sense to us, so we decided to follow suit for Thunderbird. Rather than parks, we picked beaches. A good beach is a clear and compelling example of a public good. We can all go to the beach, share in the beauty and poetry of the place, swim, maybe surf. All that&#8217;s required of us in exchange is to treat it well &#8212; don&#8217;t fence it in, don&#8217;t litter, don&#8217;t crash your oil tankers into it. Yet beaches as a public commons are under threat. If Thunderbird can help beaches and beaches can help make it clear why Thunderbird matters, we all win.

Given the weather outside, it&#8217;s not too surprising that the codename for the next version of Thunderbird is _Lanakai_, in sunny Hawaii. &#8220;Warm turquoise green waters brush up against a fine sand beach while gentle trade winds offer a cool relief from the hot Hawaiian days. This beach is great for relaxing on the sand or taking a swim in it&#8217;s clear waters&#8221;. That pretty much sold us. Also, we can dream about having a Thunderbird summit there someday.
