I&#8217;m using Thunderbird&#8217;s nifty Gmail interface to pull all of my gmail email down. Yesterday, things were fine and it was getting 400-500 emails at a time. Today it seems to be throttled down to 1-4 emails at a time, meaning that I&#8217;m still getting stuff from July 2006. Is that a known behavior? Makes Gmail&#8217;s POP interface somewhat less useful&#8230;

[update: filed a bug w/ google, got a followup which explained that they were working on it, and now that I&#8217;m back on my home mac, the problem appears to be solved!]
