I&apos;m not quite sure how [Fredrik](http://online.effbot.org/2004_08_01_archive.htm#20040815) found out about my blog.  
I suspect it&apos;s because I linked to his blog, one of the very few people  
who know about my blog clicked on the link, and he looked at the  
referrals from his logs. Fascinating (yes, I know, i&apos;m easily amused).

Investigation makes me think my brother&apos;s the key link. He&apos;s even more  
easily amused, which is good ðŸ˜‰
