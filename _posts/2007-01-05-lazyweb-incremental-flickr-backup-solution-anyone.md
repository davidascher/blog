Oh lazyweb:

Does anyone know of a working incremental flickr backup system? I have used Net::Flickr::Backup once (after much fighting with Perl), but it hasn&#8217;t been updated to work with the new Net::Flickr::API, IIRC.

The GUI apps that I&#8217;ve seen (Java-based FlickrBackup, others) don&#8217;t seem to deal well with 5000+ pictures, and don&#8217;t seem to support incremental backups anyway).

(I&#8217;ve considered paying for the service from Flickr, but it&#8217;s a bit too pricey for my taste).
