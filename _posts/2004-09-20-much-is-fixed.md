Word of this blog leaked out faster than I expected, with people correctly  
pointing out that the blog was far from technically up to snuff (e.g.  
the RSS feed didn&apos;t validate _at all_ &#8212; thanks, [Ted!](http://www.sauria.com/blog)). I&apos;ve backed away from  
using blosxom 3 alpha (t&apos;is alpha!) and am using pyblosxom 1.0. I also  
like being able to hack the code. Let me know if there are other things  
I&apos;m doing wrong.
