Note to people interested in solving the nasty problems of timezone support in calendaring:

<cite>CalConnect (The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium) will host a one-day Timezone Workshop on Tuesday, February 3, 2009, at Microsoft in Redmond, Washington. This workshop is intended for and open by invitation to parties with an interest in Timezones, how they are currently implemented and managed, and what to do about them in the future. We particularly want to attract representatives of other industry and technology areas to gain a broad perspective on the problems with Timezones as implemented today, and the relevance of our proposed direction. You do not need to be a CalConnect member to attend the workshop. Please see <a href="http://www.calconnect.org/timezoneworkshop.shtml">http://www.calconnect.org/timezoneworkshop.shtml</a> for more information, and to request an invitation to the event.</cite>
