So, this twitter thing. Or maybe, I should say, this twitter category, in which I&#8217;ll lump Twitter, Pownce, FriendFeed, Facebook status updates, etc.

What to think of it?

First, an admission: I feel like I don&#8217;t yet know what I&#8217;m talking about, in the sense that I don&#8217;t _feel_ the value proposition yet the way I do for other tech like IM, email, IRC, campfire, VoIP, etc. I&#8217;ve spent longer than I really enjoyed on Facebook, and I&#8217;ve had accounts on many of these systems for a long time, but I haven&#8217;t drunk the koolaid enough to &#8220;get it&#8221;.

Second, a question: What&#8217;s the right way to do the experiment? Is it twitterrific, twitterfox, friendfeed, something else? I&#8217;ve accepted the 29 &#8220;follow requests&#8221; that had accumulated and that I didn&#8217;t know about, and signed up to follow a bunch of people I know in various ways, and I&#8217;ll triage that list down as I expect the volume to be too high. Anyway, we&#8217;ll see how the experiment goes. My twitter account is the extremely unoriginal &#8220;davidascher&#8221;, btw.

I&#8217;m also &#8220;tracking&#8221; the terms Thunderbird and Shredder as well. The former is already proving interesting, the latter not so much =)

One idea [Andrew](http://www.visophyte.org/blog/) had was to use it to share status among the extended Thunderbird team, inasmuch as IRC isn&#8217;t perfect (and, while it may sound shocking to some Mozilla folks, I don&#8217;t think IRC is perfect =). At the same time, some of the flaws I see in IRC (like the difficulty of identifying the important stuff among the random chatter, the difficulty in finding out what happened while you were not online, etc.) don&#8217;t seem any easier to solve with twitter (as compared to something _like_ [Campfire](http://www.campfirenow.com/)).

Third, an architectural note: The currently hotly debated Twitter scaling problems, as I understand them, seem unavoidable in a centralized architecture. Decentralized messaging systems seem to scale better. You gotta wonder..
