&#8230; that I mentioned a few days ago are at [on slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/avantgame/creating-alternate-realities-or-hacking-happiness).

Slideshare is an interesting experiment &#8212; youtube for powerpoints.

Feature idea for slideshare: links to the amazon pages for the books mentioned in the talks.
