This article by Wayne Mery will show up in the next about:mozilla newsletter, and says it all:

> Or more correctly, Thunderbird is putting bugs in the cross hairs. As part of it&#8217;s attention to users and quality, the reinvigorated [Thunderbird team](http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/) has announced weekly [Thunderbird Bugdays](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Bugdays). Bug day will be held [every Thursday](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Bugdays#Schedule) as part of a multi-pronged effort: 1) to reduce the number of bugs in the bugzilla database to a more manageable level &#8211; for both confirmed and unconfirmed bugs, 2) to respond to and assist bug reporters in a more timely manner, and 3) to improve the quality of the bugs in the database such that they are more easily acted upon by developers and volunteer hackers.

> Bug day brings together seasoned Thunderbird users and users new to the bug process each week for a day of bug squishing/squashing/mashing/improvement. [#bugday on IRC](irc://irc.mozilla.org/#bugday) is the vehicle for veterans to help and mentor new participants. [#bugday](irc://irc.mozilla.org/#bugday) is also the collaboration tool that allows everyone can help each other, to gang up on bugs, and have fun.

> The Thunderbird team needs your help to make bug days effective and fun, so please take a look at our [planning document](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Bugdays_Planning) and add your thoughts to the wiki or post in the [dev newsgroup](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.thunderbird/topics).

> To quote k5ehx from our second bugday, &#8220;Bug Squashing is fun!&#8221; To all Thunderbird enthusiasts, we look forward to your involvement. 

Thanks Wayne and Gary for leading this great effort!
