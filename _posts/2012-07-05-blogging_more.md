Twitter&#8217;s been great, but it&#8217;s very much robbed me of energy to blog, which is unfortunate.  In a possibly foolish attempt to use a public statement of intent to shape my own behavior, I&#8217;m hereby saying that I&#8217;m going to try and blog more, and likely tweet less.  Not sure how to make it happen yet, as this is not a new desire on my part.
