Over a year ago, my friends [Avi and Andrew](http://dabbledb.com) convinced me to buy a Danger Hiptop phone from Fido (one of three cellphone carriers in BC). The phone is an odd phone, but it had this great feature &#8212; $20/month unlimited data, including coverage throughout Canada and the US. Meaning email, web access, and instant messaging are all included. It was a great deal. I signed up, including the contract (the phone without the contract was prohibitively expensive). I was resigned to being stuck with a phone that I knew would get outdated, because I knew the alternatives would make using phone-based email/web browsing way too expensive.

Since then, Fido&#8217;s attitude towards that plan has changed. They took it off the market, presumably because they were losing money at it. Oops.

The first month I roamed, I got roaming charges when in the US. I called, and the charges were dropped (that sounds so &#8220;dangerous&#8221;!). Haven&#8217;t had a roaming charge since.

Until last month, alerted by Avi, who had a nasty surprise. This time, two frustrating calls to customer service later (including typing my phone number twice, saying it at least twice, getting a call dropped, being on hold forever). Turns out their US partner didn&#8217;t renew the deal for roaming, so they passed the buck (literally) to the customers. After some wrangling, they agree to drop the extra charges for the last month, but I can&#8217;t get them to stick by the spirit of the original terms (turns out the data deal isn&#8217;t part of the contract term, just a &#8220;changeable&#8221; add-on. Gee, thanks).

Now it turns out that coincidentally the hiptop is broken (again). A few months ago, I broke the screen, but I resigned myself to pay for it. This time, since an unsolicited operating system upgrade, it won&#8217;t read the SIM card, making it useless. The only way to get someone at Fido to look at the phone is to take a 1/2 day, go out to the repair center on Kingsway, and, I predict, be told that it&#8217;ll cost several hundred dollars to fix it, or hey, I can buy a new phone.

At this point, I&#8217;m in the market for a new carrier, a new email-capable phone, and a new plan. Alternatively, I might just go to a cheap phone & cheap plan until the iPhone lands. Any suggestions?

(NB: for the unaware reader, this is Canada, and the national cellphone industry is even more broken than in the US, which is saying something).
