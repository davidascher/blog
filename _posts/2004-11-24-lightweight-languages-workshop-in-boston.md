The program for the [lightweight languages workshop](http://ll4.csail.mit.edu/) is set (just in time, too &#8212; it&#8217;s on Dec 4!). I got to read the abstracts as I&#8217;m on the PC, and I wish I could be there to hear the talks. Go there and blog about it please! I&#8217;m particularly interested in the &#8220;Debugging without Programming&#8221; and &#8220;Frink&#8221; talks, but a lot of the conversations are bound to be a lot of fun.
