One of the TODO items I brought back from France last year was to start a discussion area for what I&#8217;ve been thinking of as &#8220;organizational deployments&#8221; &#8212; everything related to making it easier for organizations to deploy Thunderbird, in particular in larger organizations, where the scale of these deployments makes the &#8220;standard&#8221; processes hard to manage. (Yes, the standard term is &#8220;enterprise&#8221; users, but I find that word problematic &#8212; still, it&#8217;s the same topic)

Well, someone beat me to it. Mike Kaply, a Firefox advocate within IBM, [setup](http://www.kaply.com/weblog/2008/01/03/firefox-enterprise-newsgroup/) a few great starting points:

  * A wiki [page](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Enterprise)
  * A mailing list / newsgroup, which can be accessed multiple ways:  
    You can access the newsgroup multiple ways:</p> 
      * [mozilla.community.enterprise on news.mozilla.org](news://news.mozilla.org/mozilla.community.enterprise)
      * [mozilla.community.enterprise on Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.community.enterprise)
      * [mozilla.community.enterprise mailing list](https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/community-enterprise)

These will be great place to discuss things that are Mozilla-general. We may even find it a fine place to branch out discussions of Thunderbird specific issues, as I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if topics that may seem Thunderbird specific have analogs in Firefox-land, or at least could benefit from platform-level attention.

If we need to create a Thunderbird specific mailing list, we can do that, but let&#8217;s start on the shared list first. I know that many of the topics I&#8217;ve heard about, from auto-configuration, to more control over AUS, to hosting add-ons sites, etc., are cross-product issues.

I look forward to hearing from institutional users, corporate, educational, governmental, and other!
