We had a lecture on posture and personalized assessment of posture and ergonomics at work today. That included an (unflatteringly accurate, but at least confidential) photograph of everyone&#8217;s posture against a plumb line and wall-mounted grid. The main revelation for me, in addition to confirming my fairly obvious slouch, is that I lean to the left by a few degrees. No surprises there, except that I didn&#8217;t know you could tell political bias from a photograph. You learn something new everyday!
