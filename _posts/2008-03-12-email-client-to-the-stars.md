In an [interview to the London Times](http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/article3525110.ece), Ray Tomlinson, described as the inventor of e-mail, explains that he uses Thunderbird.

The more substantive comment in my mind:

Does he think, given the development of other forms of electronic communication such as instant messaging and social networking, that his creation will stand the test of time?

&#8220;I suspect possibly we’ll see a morphing of e-mail and other, more instant methods,&#8221; he says, &#8220;but there will always be a need for people to be able communicate asynchronously, that is, send messages that won’t be read or replied to immediately, and that’s what e-mail allows you to do.”
