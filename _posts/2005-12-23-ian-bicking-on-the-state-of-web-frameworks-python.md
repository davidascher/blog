Ian Bicking says a lot of things, not all of which I agree with.&nbsp; But his latest post titled <a title="Site: Ian Bicking: A Blog" href="http://blog.ianbicking.org/theres-so-much-more-than-rails.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&#8220;There&#8217;s so much more than Rails&#8221;</a> is all goodness, from my POV.
