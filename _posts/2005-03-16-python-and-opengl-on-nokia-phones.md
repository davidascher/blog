Sitting here at ETech, just after Erik Smartt, product manager for the Python on Nokia product, gave the first real public demo of the [Symbian/Series 60 port of Python](http://www.forum.nokia.com/main/0,,034-821,00.html). The highlight was a PyOpenGL demo (the code isn&#8217;t available yet, and the author is not public either). Click on the picture for the Quicktime movie.

As someone who worked on PyOpenGL a _long, long time ago_ on high end Silicon Graphics workstations, it&#8217;s fairly stunning to see it fit into a pocket.

Also notable was a demo of the FlashLite stuff, which is equally cool, but probably available elsewhere (if not, I&#8217;ll post a movie later).
