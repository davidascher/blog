Here&#8217;s something interesting &#8212; Florian Queze and Quentin Castier just released [Instantbird](http://instantbird.com/), which is a XUL application wrapped around [libpurple](http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple), the library behind [Pidgin](http://pidgin.im/) (once GAIM), [Adium](http://www.adiumx.com/), [Meebo](http://wwwm.meebo.com/), and others. There are some licensing issues around doing the same in Thunderbird right now, but it&#8217;s nice to see that some people are connecting these various technologies in interesting ways.
