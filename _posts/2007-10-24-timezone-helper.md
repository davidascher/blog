Dear Lazyweb,

I&#8217;m recruiting globally, and that means that I spend a fair bit of time trying to coordinate phone call times involving several timezones. Is there a good website or OS X dashboard widget or &#8230; that people have found handy for that? The sites I&#8217;ve tried so far have been reasonable at asking the question &#8220;when is time X in timezone Y&#8221;, but then leave delta computations to me, and those end up error-prone.
