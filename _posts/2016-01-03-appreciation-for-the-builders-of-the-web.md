I just spent a couple of days playing around with ideas, words to describe those ideas, and code to make those ideas come to life. It had been quite a few months since I&#8217;d spent the time to sharpen my tools, and while the challenges to the web are greater than ever, it&#8217;s also a more impressive toolkit than ever.

I&#8217;d like to call out a few heroes whose generous work as open source and easily accessible services have made the last couple of days particularly fun:

  * The folks at Heroku
  * The amazing perseverance of @automattic and the WordPress team, whose recent moves to both redo the front-end and open-source the .com site are one of a long string of bold and ambitious moves.
  * The energy and diligence of the Ghost team
  * The JS module hackers who make github and npm useful as opposed to just necessary
  * Brock and the rest of the Surge.sh team for a product that &#8220;just works&#8221;
  * The Firebase team, for not shutting down one of the tools I think has managed to bridge the ergonomics of a Heroku with the developer power that AWS-style services provide
  * AWS, for paving the way (and because even S3 is still remarkable)
  * The React team at Facebook & beyond, who are boldly moving the client side forward
  * The Material Design team at Google, for taking design seriously and then implementing it in an accessible way.
  * The LetsEncrypt team, one of the projects I&#8217;m proud to say Mozilla had a big hand in.

Thank you all.
