Next Sunday, just before the [Open Web conference](http://www.openwebvancouver.ca/), we&#8217;re organizing a get-together of people who hack on Mozilla-related code. Details from Shane Caraveo:

> MozCamp Vancouver, Sunday April 13, 12pm to 5pm 

> Location:  
> ActiveState  
> 1700-409 Granville Street  
> Vancouver 

> I am glad to announce Mozcamp, an informal gathering of developers who  
> work on XUL applications and extensions. We&#8217;ll start the day with a brief intro from each attendee, covering what they work on and what they are interested in discussing. We can then self organize for the rest of the afternoon. Any topic is accepted, from development issues to strategy and beyond. 

> Vancouver and Victoria have a number of organizations that currently  
> develop mozilla-based applications, such as Mozilla Messaging  
> (Thunderbird), Flock, Songbird, Brand Thunder and ActiveState (Komodo  
> IDE). Representatives from these organizations will be attending, and  
> as well this event is also open to anyone who works on mozilla-based  
> applications, extensions, or related technologies. ActiveState is  
> providing the space, Mozilla is providing the pizza. Space is limited,  
> so please RSVP to Shane Caraveo (shanec at ActiveState-dotcom)  
> as soon as possible. 

Should be good!
