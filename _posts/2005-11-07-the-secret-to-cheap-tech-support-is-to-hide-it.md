Bought a Dell laptop a year or so ago. Got the fancy warranty to deal with the inevitable juice spills. Juice spill happens. Tried to get a replacement keyboard. It is stunningly hard to get to the right part of the website (being in Canada doesn&#8217;t help). Tried calling. On hold for a half-hour. No wonder Dell&#8217;s stock is struggling. They forgot what got them successful in the first place&#8230;

Next laptop won&#8217;t be a Dell.
