A few months ago, we needed more desks for our office, so I figured I&#8217;d order them from the Ikea website. Easy to do, except that the Ikea.ca store doesn&#8217;t work with US credit cards, and our corporate card is a US card. So I bite my tongue about the craziness of e-commerce in Canada, knowing it&#8217;s not just an Ikea problem, and I use my personal card, and will deal with expensing it internally. Annoying, but oh well.

Then I&#8217;m blown away because delivery takes eons, because the desks have to come from the &#8220;online distribution center&#8221; in Quebec (&#8220;it&#8217;s Canada, so it&#8217;s got to be close, right?&#8221;), and not from either of the two warehouses within 20 miles of the delivery address (who do have the items in stock!). But I&#8217;m busy, so I live w/ the delay. Environmentally criminal, but oh well.

This month, we need more desks, and I&#8217;ve learned my lesson, so I know to take time out of my weekend to go to Ikea, order the desks and chairs. After about 45 minutes in the store, it looks like we&#8217;ll have delivery on Tuesday morning. A few high-end desks and what seems like their most expensive chairs, but I have a soft spot for Ikea, and their furniture is working out fine for us.

Turns out the chairs aren&#8217;t in stock, so they have to be scheduled for delivery a few weeks out and delivery has to be charged separately. Annoying, and a bit more expensive, but oh well.

Monday, they call and say that we hadn&#8217;t talked about delivery times (we had), and we reschedule it for the same day/time. Seems disorganized, but oh well.

Tuesday, they come and call my cell to let us know they&#8217;re downstairs, but I&#8217;m on the phone on an important call, and I thought it was someone else, so I figure I&#8217;ll get the message when I&#8217;m done with my call. By the time I get off the phone, I&#8217;m told they went on with their route, and I need to reschedule another delivery, which will cost me $75. Frustrating, but I blame it on the olympics and how it&#8217;s messing with deliveries everywhere, and blame myself for not taking the call, but oh well.

I call back to reschedule, and I&#8217;m told that I need to go _back to the store_ to reschedule, because I need to pay for another delivery. WTF? After a bit of back and forth with the CSR, I ask to talk to a manager, and I&#8217;m told to do that I need to _go to the store_. WTF? I then ask about canceling the order, and I&#8217;m told that, you guessed it, I need to go _back to the store_.

Oh, if I want to lodge a complaint, I can do it on their website. I&#8217;ll definitely be sending them a link to this page.

I guess I know what I&#8217;m doing this weekend. What I&#8217;m not sure of is where I&#8217;ll get the next batch of furniture from. What a totally horrible customer experience, just because they don&#8217;t have a system for paying over the phone (or, hey, the internet?!?!) for silly delivery fees.
