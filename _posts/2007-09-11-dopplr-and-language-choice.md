I just joined [Dopplr](http://www.dopplr.com/) (at this point, why not?). The idea of a social network aimed at facilitating connections between people based on the congruence of their travel plans is intriguing. In some ways it&#8217;s a longer-timescale, spatially richer version of our more granular but geographically limited [Up4 app](http://ascher.ca/blog/2007/08/17/a-facebook-story/). We&#8217;ll see if it is actually useful in practice (shudder!).

Anyway &#8212; in Dopplr, contacts aren&#8217;t called friends (thank you!), they&#8217;re called &#8220;fellow travelers&#8221;. I liked the name, and mentioned it to Emily. She knows a lot more about words than I do, and thought it was a funny choice, as the term used to be a [code name for communist sympathizers](http://www.answers.com/fellow+traveler&r=67). After 30 seconds of searching, I haven&#8217;t seen any hint on google that the etymology was a factor in the choice.
