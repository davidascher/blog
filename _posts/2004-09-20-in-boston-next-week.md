In case anyone cares, I&#8217;ll be at [SD Best Practices](http://www.sdexpo.com/) in Boston next week, giving a [talk](http://www.cmpevents.com/SDe4/a.asp?option=C&V=11&SessID=3152&Mgt=0&RVid=0) on why and how to use open source in &#8220;regular&#8221; development projects. I&#8217;m also going to be seeing some friends from [way back](http://www.brown.edu), which will be fun.
