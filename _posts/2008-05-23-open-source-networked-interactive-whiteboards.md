If you&#8217;ve never seen Johnny Lee&#8217;s videos explaining how he uses cheap Wii remotes to do amazing things, check out the [TED video](http://blip.tv/file/897059), or [his home page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~johnny/projects/wii/).

Now after watching that video, I snuck into the ActiveState game room, and poked around with the wiimotes & projector there. I&#8217;ll definitely be keeping an eye on the [wiimote project](http://www.wiimoteproject.com/).

Now someone needs to hook that project up with some of the open source screen-sharing software, and all kinds of cool things could happen.

Speaking of which &#8212; any recommendations for inexpensive projectors (for presentations, not home theater stuff)?
