[Greg Wilson](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gvwilson/), who&#8217;se writing a few books at the same time (silly boy!) [says](http://www.livejournal.com/users/gvwilson/10282.html):

> I hate drawing diagrams

I guess I understand Greg less than I thought I did. One of the few things I miss about my previous career as a scientist is that I don&#8217;t get to draw nearly enough pretty diagrams. I love drawing diagrams. I would pay to draw diagrams!

I&#8217;m reminded of a great keynote at the last [ETech](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) by [Marc Smith](http://research.microsoft.com/~masmith/), a sociologist who works at Microsoft. Marc was introducing some cool visualizations and said something like:

> I am a sinner in the church of [Tufte](http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/).

bringing down the house, for that&#8217;s exactly what it feels like.
