Every now and then, a UI concept is so good that it becomes contagious in fascinating and frustrating ways. I&#8217;ve run across two recently.

The first is the iPhone touch screen. A few months ago, when I first got my iPhone, after playing with it for about 30 minutes, I went back to work on my mac, and my fingers automatically expected things like the two-finger zoom to work. I was stunned. Not surprisingly, that is now a feature of the new Macbook Air, and I expect it&#8217;ll be in all mac laptops.

The second occurred to me this morning. I was using ssh (a command line tool) to log in to a variety of machines with cryptic addresses, and I knew that I had to start looking for a place to write down those username/hostname combinations. At the same time, I realized that what I really wanted was the awesomebar for my terminal window. The notion that &#8220;the computer&#8221; should just remember what you&#8217;ve done no matter where, because past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior, and that we can implement that quite well with simple mechanisms like keeping a history and doing some math on that history, is a contagious idea. (Note to unix weenies: I know that with the right magic i can get some pseudo-awesomebar within bash. Not good enough! I want bookmarks, tags, weave!)

Naturally, it applies to Thunderbird as well. I routinely go back to &#8220;the same&#8221; emails. We should find a way to make that as obvious and invisible as Firefox 3 does for web pages.
