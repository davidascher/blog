So far, [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) is still quite nice. I had some configuration problems (it didn&#8217;t help that I was also trying to setup a new OS X box at the same time), but nothing that a little perseverance and the kind help of people on the #django channel couldn&#8217;t fix.

Django is still clearly evolving quickly (which I like), with some fascinating discussions on the mailing list as to the proper role for AJAX-style toolkits in a tool like Django. Django doesn&#8217;t (yet?) have the insane buzz that Ruby on Rails has, but the fact that I know Python (and the Python libraries) makes me feel like I will be productive much faster w/ Django than with Rails. I&#8217;ll probably poke at Rails periodically as well, to see how that&#8217;s evolving.

Other tools I had good interactions with today: subversion, trac. Apart from the fact that the Powerbook keyboards bboouunnnceee a lot on me, I&#8217;m having a Good Computer Day.
