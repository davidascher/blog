I&#8217;m thinking a catchy headline will grab eyeballs. Furthermore, it&#8217;s actually true. The <span class="caps">PSF</span> issued a short-but-sweet [call for proposals](http://www.python.org/psf/call-2004.html). It&#8217;s as open-ended as we could make it, and leaves many questions unanswered. So we also created a [mailing list](http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/grants-discuss) for discussion of said questions. Come one, come all. It&#8217;s an interesting time for Python; we can actually put money towards rewarding interesting projects. Deadline for proposals is October 1.
