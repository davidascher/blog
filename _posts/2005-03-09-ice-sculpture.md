NPR has [an interview](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4528632) with someone I&#8217;d like to meet someday. John Reeves, self-described freeform industrial ice artist, spent a winter building an ice sculpture in his back yard using industrial sprinklers and, over months, 160 feet of pipe. [His website](http://alaskanalpineclub.org/IceWall/04-05IceWall1.html) details the process, step by freezing step. I like an artist with a sense of humor.
