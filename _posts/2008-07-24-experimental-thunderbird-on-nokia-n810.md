Check out what [Dolske did](http://blog.mozilla.com/dolske/2008/07/24/thunderbird-on-maemo/). Cool!

Interestingly, I had another interesting conversation today about the need to think about adapting Thunderbird for use in small form-factor devices (like the subnotebooks/netpc&#8217;s that are coming out). Not coincidental, methinks.
