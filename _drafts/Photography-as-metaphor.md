I broke my arm over Christmas break.

The experience was memorable in many ways: I remember the initial embarrassment of falling an entire flight of stairs simply because I hadn&#8217;t _thought_ hard enough about the implications of slippery socks and polished wooden stairs; I remember the remarkably positive experience of interacting with more French public servants than I have in decades, and feeling very well treated both by humans and by the system. Probably most vividly, I remember learning about new kinds and magnitude of pain. Of course that was followed by the slow realization that my day-to-day life was going to be different for a while, and the dull ache that is uncertainty about what abilities might never come back, trying to disentangle those I would miss, and those which would make me rage. In the aftermath, a friend with a passion in photography gave me the excuse I needed to buy a new camera that I&#8217;d been lusting at for a while: 

> &#8220;It&#8217;s important to forgive yourself.&#8221;

So I bought a camera, and have been having fun forgiving myself, spending less time on hackernews and more time on photo sites, and more importantly, walking around the world seeing it more intentionally, even if holding a camera with one hand is a real handicap. That&#8217;s the personal context for this post.

The professional context is that I&#8217;ve been spending much of my thinking time on the early phase of product creation. As I&#8217;ll write about more soon, I&#8217;m rethinking how Mozilla should think about our early innovation initiatives (which, as is typical for Mozilla, come from a wide range of minds, cultures, and expectations); I&#8217;m also digging into WebFWD, our accelerator program, understanding the foundations that Pascal, Diane and Didem have built, and learning from it. In Vancouver, my willingness to hear pitches and provide feedback and guidance to very young companies is apparently spreading, as I&#8217;m getting into more and more such conversations, whether with young founders or governmental types trying to understand and help nurture them. 

In addition to being encouraged by the enthusiasm, creativity and ambition that these conversations reveal, I also end up doing pattern recognition over these projects and the people who push them forward, looking for organizing principles, and the resulting predictive power.

This week, I had such a proto-thought which emerged out of the blending of my interest in photography and organizations, and Avi Bryant (a [long game teammate](http://lilly.tumblr.com/post/30559372196/go-long) for sure) encouraged me to expand on it, so here goes.

## Characterizing organizational approaches as lenses

In my conversation with Avi, I reached for optical terms to describe those organizations that attract me. I&#8217;m naturally drawn to projects with a wide field of view &#8212; those who may be tackling a small thing at a time, but doing so in a wider context &#8212; historical, economic, social, developmental. That context, to me, brings meaning to the daily challenges which can otherwise get mundane. The question is whether that analogy has any legs. 

### What lens types are good for what

_Telephoto lenses_ are like telescopes. Only a small part of the world can enter their field of view. Within that field of view, however, they can see more detail than others. And in practice, they can see things that are further away, in some ways looking into the future. A telephoto, wielded appropriately, lets us see details that we would otherwise not see because in a normal view, those details are blurry. And whether those details are compelling to you or not will depend, like all photographs, on the story they tell, and whether you&#8217;re ready for it.

_Wide angle lenses_ behave differently. A wide angle lens looks at a large field of view, but focuses the image on a particular distance. A &#8220;fast, bright lens&#8221; lets a skilled photographer tell a crisp story by isolating a subject not just through the box in space & time that the still image defines, but through focus. Typically there&#8217;s not much in front of the subject, and the background is blurred enough that it&#8217;s not distracting, but mood-setting instead. Amateur photographers will argue about the various qualities of blurriness (bokeh); masters seem to instead think about the story, the framing, the composition, the light. The central purpose of the shot is the story rather than the subject.

In my (limited) experience, good wide angle shots tend to tell more interesting stories, telephoto shots tend to show more unique subjects. Bad telephoto shots are junk; bad wide angle shots are boring.

Birders, spies, sports photographers are the ideal consumers of telephoto lenses, because their job is to find things that the human eye can&#8217;t see. We like those shots because we discover the color of an eagle&#8217;s iris, we like seeing the sweat and emotion on the race car driver&#8217;s face mid-turn, or the diplomat handing over state secrets. The subject is the point. Optics and time are adversaries &#8212; high quality telephoto lenses tend to be huge, heavy and expensive, and, as with a telescope, figuring out where to point them and how to hold them steady are critical challenges. Taking a great telephoto shot seems to me to be about having those technical skills, then anticipating the world so that when the subject is where you think it will be, you are ready to capture it.

Telephoto teams are those teams which solve the problem you need solved exceedingly well and better/faster than anyone else. It could be a marketing skill, a deep technical skill, even a type of sales. When they&#8217;re the right fit for the problem, they knock it out of the park.

In wide angle shots, the attention is drawn to a composition, an interplay of subjects more or less in focus. The wide angle photographs I most like are those that are read in layers. You notice the subject, sharply in focus compared to the rest of the frame. You read the mood of the subject (be it a face or a building), and then you look around, and ideally notice something that the photographer wanted you to notice. Someone or something else is in the frame, and by noticing that other subject the entire story shifts. All of a sudden the story you thought you were seeing is much more interesting. My feeling about these shots is that while there are technical challenges, the real genius emerges from empathy and story telling skills &#8212; capturing the subject in a grid of pixels isn&#8217;t particularly hard with modern cameras; communicating the right context to elicit an emotional response &#8211; that&#8217;s the challenge.

Good wide angle teams are multidisciplinary and coordinated. They understand as a group why the project is relevant, timely, compelling, and what&#8217;s needed to have in the frame, what should be out of the frame, and what should be in the background, blurry but mood-setting. A bad wide angle team will result in a cluttered product &#8212; there will be more features than make sense; the various aspects of the product (brand, esthetics, UX, ecosystem fit) won&#8217;t gel as one. An excellent one makes you see just what they want you to see, and makes everything else disappear.

There are other ways of mashing up the language of optics and the world of product companies. Some are obvious &#8212; strategy is about looking at the broader landscape, anticipating what&#8217;s going on in the world, and figuring out where to setup for a shot, what lens to put on the body. To execute well means being ready before you need to press the shutter. Having decided what story you&#8217;re telling, being able to settle on a focus distance and depth of field means that you can ignore minor details in the background (or even foreground sometimes). 

It&#8217;s also easy to call out limitations of the analogy, in particular when it comes to timescales &#8212; organizations take months or years to reconfigure, whereas lenses take seconds to switch.

Most photographers have a kit of lenses, but most companies and executive teams don&#8217;t know how to operate well at multiple focal lengths. The greats can &#8212; Apple, Google come to mind, as organizations with a remarkable ability to tell compelling, broad stories, as well as to execute remarkably in some exceedingly tight frames (design, manufacturing, search, etc.). On our best days, I think Mozilla has similar ambitions, and I&#8217;ll let others judge our results. But most companies, certainly most small companies, do well to start with a single lens, and then make sure to look up often enough to make sure they&#8217;re pointing it in the right direction. 

Is there utility in this analogy, then, or am I forcing it? Time (and readers) will tell, but I&#8217;m finding it intriguing at the least. Am I a wide-angle lens, or is the choice of lens the choice of a role within a team, intentional but not definitional? Is a well-run organization a skilled photographer? Are co-founders the complementary primes in a minimal kit?

Tying this back to my [previous post](http://blog.ascher.ca/2013/02/01/saas-as-a-service/), I do end up thinking about the impact of economic disruptors. In the photography world, the big news of the last couple of years is the advent of mirrorless cameras, in particular the micro 4/3rds consortium. By embracing digital technologies deeply, a broad set of manufacturers have been able to build cameras and accompanying lenses that are smaller, lighter, and cheaper to build than the previous generation, for similar optical quality. As a result, many self-described &#8220;pros&#8221; appear to be switching from an old form factor (full frame DSLRs) to these newer, smaller, more agile form factors. I&#8217;m probably overgeneralizing, but the impact of SaaS on software products feels similar. The mechanics of photography/business haven&#8217;t changed fundamentally, but the agility and flexibility have &#8212; those in dynamic environments which reward that are leading the change.

Anyway, my personal reflection on this analogy is that I care about story and context, and I care that my work speaks to as many viewers as possible. I realize that I&#8217;m more likely to be called a dilettante than a perfectionist. I&#8217;m naturally drawn to zooming out, looking around, and then zooming in _just a bit_. I aspire to tell stories like [these by Alex Webb](http://lens.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/alex-webb-rendering-a-complex-world-in-color-and-black-and-white/?ref=global-home), or products that have that special blend of technology and relevance to human needs.
