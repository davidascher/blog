The next phase of Collusion

Last week, I had the privilege of hosting a great meeting focused on the next phase of the Collusion project. With generous support from the Ford Foundation, we&#8217;re tackling a significant next phase in Collusion&#8217;s evolution.

First, a bit of background. Collusion [link] started off as experiment by Atul Varma, in his quest to understand how cookies and advertising actually worked on the web. Since that initial version, Collusion has evolved into a popular and influential Firefox add-on. Collusion has hundreds of thousands of users, and it&#8217;s helped us teach a lot of people about the web, as in [link] this TED presentation by Gary Kovacs. Collusion has also been forked, with [link] ports to Chrome and Safari from Disconnect.me.

Collusion, like many Mozilla projects, makes progress with contributions from staff, partners, and volunteer contributors. In this particular case, we have an interesting collection of people who will be contribute in distinctive ways, from coding to visualization to infrastructure and metrics. Also like all Mozilla projects, Collusion is a project open to participation by others, as I&#8217;ll mention in more detail below.

Over the next year or so, we agreed to dig in and take Collusion forward in a few significant ways. 

First, we realize that the user experience of Collusion needs refining and evolution. The current add-on is most compelling when in the context of a demo, or a tutorial, but it could do more story-telling and explaining of what it&#8217;s showing than it could today. Second, the visualization of the connected graph that is so compelling needs some tweaks, both in terms of scaling to larger graphs, as well as simply presentation and visual design tweaks.

We also realize that the current add-on experience can lead to users who are surprised by what they learn about third-party tracking on the web, but it gives little in the way of actionable next steps on the web. The point of Collusion isn&#8217;t just to &#8220;freak people out&#8221;, but to allow them to understand tracking, control how they&#8217;re being tracked, and lead to a better internet experience for all. We have yet to define the details of all of those next steps are, but some of them seem fairly clear.

Understanding that there are different kinds of uses of shared third-party HTTP requests (which is what Collusion tracks). Some of them are fully in line with a user&#8217;s desires and intents, and some are not. We need to let users figure out which ones they want to see used, and which ones they&#8217;d rather avoid. 

Much of this will start with letting users choose to contribute data to a crowd-sourced data set about tracking on the web. Much like we&#8217;ve done with the [test pilot] project, we will build a system which lets Collusion users contribute to creating a rich data set about the web as seen by real users. This data set will then be usable by researchers and others to better understand how the technologies of the web are being used, so as to foster both a better understanding of today&#8217;s web by users, as well as policymakers and industry.

I&#8217;m excited to be part of this effort, which I believe has a chance to have meaningful impact on a broad set of actors, in part because we&#8217;ll be relying on input from a diverse set of perspectives, from designers and artists who will help us build further compelling visualizations of the data that we collect, to privacy researchers who will help us ask better questions of our data.

In the next few weeks, we&#8217;ll setup the &#8220;heartbeat&#8221; bits of the project &#8212; a weekly call, IRC channel, mailing lists, likely a blog, etc. If you&#8217;re interested in participating, check out the [wiki page] for details, or contact me directly.
