My recent Skype conversations with Ward Cunningham fit into the last two categories. I have known of Ward, and his remarkable creativity for years (inventing wiki, huge contributor to the agile school of thought, recently poking at important topics like sustainability and open data), but had never &#8220;dug deep&#8221; him. As he probably knows, it&#8217;s easy to dismiss him as a bit of a wacko. Over the last few weeks, I&#8217;ve had the great pleasure of talking with him in depth about federated wiki, his (simplistically named) new big idea. And as my friend Simon said, it&#8217;s making me do mental backflips, providing me that primal joy associated with stretching intellectual muscles &#8212; something which feels especially nice since I recently broke an arm and my physical mobility is quite limited.

I&#8217;m hoping to write more about federated wiki soon, as I immerse myself more into it, and hopefully find something to contribute to that effort, whose societal ambitions I&#8217;m just starting to uncover.

In a different conversation with Avi Bryant, I stumbled on a metaphor which has been bouncing around in my head.
