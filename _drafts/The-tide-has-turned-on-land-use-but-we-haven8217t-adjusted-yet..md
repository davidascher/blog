It&#8217;s late, I&#8217;ve been up for way too long, and I&#8217;m headed on a trip tomorrow. I should be doing lots of things but not this.  But tonight&#8217;s public consultation meeting with the staff from the BC Ministry of Forests has me considering this moment in history.

The summary is that Gambier Island, a sparsely populated island only 40m away from Vancouver, but home to old growth forests, wild lakes, and both memories for tens of thousands of Vancouverites as well as promise for the future, is scheduled to be the &#8220;lucky recipient&#8221; of a couple of woodlots covering 1300 hectares.  It&#8217;s not the first lot on Gambier, there&#8217;s been one for 30 years, whose management does not match with the pretty picture that the Ministry of Logging paints in their talks and brochures.  We&#8217;ve seen what happens with a wood lot.  Scorched earth, impassable blocks of brush, trails turned into logging roads, with incredibly concentrated benefits to one individual.
