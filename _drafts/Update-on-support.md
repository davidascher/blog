Part of the run-up to releasing Thunderbird 3 is to figure out a strategy for improving end-user support. Here&#8217;s where we are, where we&#8217;re going, and how we&#8217;re getting there.

Support for Thunderbird is a huge challenge, with lots of existing destinations scattered across the web, in lots of different languages.  Many of those destinations provide great service, some not so much.  Many of those destinations are fully modern and embrace the evolving web (which is where more and more people look for help with software), others, not so much.

Figuring out how to evolve from this status quo to something better is a huge job, but I&#8217;m happy to say that I found someone willing to take on this challenge.  We&#8217;ve hired Roland Tanglao to lead the coordination effort for end-user support.  He&#8217;s been getting to know and working with all of the various communities already doing end-user support, including learning what support approaches work well, which ones could be better.

Roland has a few short terms goals so far:

**Understand who&#8217;se currently doing Thunderbird support, where, how**.  For English-language users, we know a fair bit about that already.  For non-English support, that knowledge is very decentralized (meaning: we don&#8217;t know enough =).  If you have some information about specific locales/languages, do let Roland know.

**Come up with a strategy for English-language support**.  We currently have peer-to-peer support in lots of different locations: MozillaZine, Newsgroups, mailing lists, GetSatisfaction.  To some degree, that diversity is a good thing &#8212; people who are used to getting support on MozillaZine continue to get good support there, and there are good knowledge base articles on MozillaZine that

It&#8217;s a huge challenge, for a variety of reasons:

First, the sheer numbers &#8212; millions of users, thousands of email configuration types, dozens of languages.
