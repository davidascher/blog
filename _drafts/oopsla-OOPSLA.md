I&#8217;ve been bopping in and out of the OOPSLA 2004 (Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages & Applications) conference at the local convention center. It&#8217;s a big half-academic, half-industrial conference (1600 people, some academics, some engineers, some managers).

Yesterday was a workshop on &#8220;The Revival of Dynamic Languages.&#8221; The room was fairly small, standing room only w/ 26 people in it. The organization was fairly odd &#8212; lots of short (5-10 minute) presentations, followed by discussions that spawned from the talks. In general, I found the Q&A _much_ more interesting than the actual speakers.

The vast majority of the participants seemed to be relatively &#8220;old-school&#8221; academics, with a lot of background in academically relevant languages like Self, Smalltalk, Common Lisp, etc. For all that the headline refered to a revival of dynamic languages (which in the eyes of many I talked to seem to be about the Pythons, Rubys, Groovys of the world), none of the work being talked about was actually relevant at all to any of the languages &#8220;under revival&#8221;. There was a palpable disconnect between academia and the &#8220;market-driven&#8221; world (whether open source or not). I had a good chat with Peter Drayton & Erik Meijer from Microsoft.

Today was quite different.

This morning&#8217;s keynote was by Richard Rashid, head of Microsoft Research. I missed the first third. The second third was a product demo of Visual Studio 2005 Whidbey, &#8220;Team System&#8221;. Apart from being somewhat crass at a keynote that was billed as a researchy talk, the demo was not that exciting. Microsoft seems to be pushing the depth of the tool stack ever higher &#8212; Team System seems to be about being able to build domain-specific designers for VS.Net, with the idea that in a given field (e.g. geophysics or financial models or whatever), someone can build a tool that experts in that field can then &#8216;code&#8217; with. It is also part of a general push w/in the tools groups @ microsoft to argue for a &#8220;software factory&#8221; model, something to do with &#8216;industrialization&#8217; of the software construction model. The last third of the talk was about how MS research has developed code verification tools, bug analysis tools. Some will be part of VS.Net, and they&#8217;re all heavily used within microsoft to increase the safety of code.

As is typical with talks from Microsoft managers at non-Microsoft conferences, the questions from the audience were about things like &#8220;value systems&#8221;, &#8220;privacy concerns&#8221;, &#8220;tools over people&#8221;. Must be tough =).

Overall, for a &#8220;research&#8221; talk, the content depressed me. It struck me as a reasonable, &#8220;grown up&#8221; approach to software development when dealing with teams of 50,000 people (his number), but it made me want to run away.

After that talk I went to a talk re: modernism, postmodernism, philosophy, architecture movements, and how all of that relates to software engineering and computer science. I&#8217;m not sure I can do that talk justice, since the speakers were really doing theater more than a standard presentation. The bottom line is that the &#8216;big promises&#8217; of software, implied by things like the waterfall model, correctness proofs, and, (although not explicitely said) by Microsoft&#8217;s vision of software futures, is doomed, and that&#8217;s ok. In the spearkers&#8217; view, much of &#8220;modern&#8221; developments (agile approaches, dynamic languages, etc) are simply due to an acceptance that the big ideas don&#8217;t work and don&#8217;t matter, that it&#8217;s &#8220;fine&#8221; to just go on doing &#8216;little things&#8217;, following &#8216;little stories&#8217;.

Now I&#8217;m listening to the end of Ward Cunningham&#8217;s talk (without intending to offend, it feels like a fairly standard talk from that &#8220;crowd&#8221;, AFAICT). Most interesting points: according to Ward, refactoring tools are getting good enough to make Java as useful as dynamic languages &#8212; which relates to some other stuff I heard yesterday re: Java & the quality of the tools being so high). Also,
