### Labs in Transition

In the last year, Mozilla Labs has gone through a lot of changes, with the emergence of the WebFWD program which is fostering innovation by non-Mozilla startups who are aligned with Mozilla values, and the graduation of two major initiatives from Labs to larger scale initiatives, our Apps and Identity initiative.  These (important, strategic, and exciting) developments have had some downstream impact, especially on what &#8220;Mozilla Labs&#8221; means today, and more importantly what it could or should be in the future.

The current state of Labs is something that I don&#8217;t think is worth a lot of discussion, as all of the definitions we could use are very plastic.  Instead, I&#8217;d rather start a discussion about what Labs could and should be, using inputs from as broad and well-informed group of people as possible, including people who currently self-affiliate with Labs, stakeholders from the product teams, but also non-employees who care about the future of the internet and Mozilla&#8217;s role in it.

Because wide open calls for comments tend to be low yield, I&#8217;m going to start by painting my take on what Labs is today, and follow with a fairly opinionated piece, but it&#8217;s a &#8220;strong opinion weakly held,&#8221; designed to encourage discussion.

First, my take on the &#8216;lay of the land&#8217;.

### The fuzzy boundary between Labs and Research

Mozilla has grown in the last couple of years a group call &#8220;Mozilla Research.&#8221; That group is chartered with furthering the state of the art in specific areas of computer science & systems research which are critical to the future of the internet. The kinds of work that entails include things like advances in type inferencing in dynamic languages XXX link, inventing new systems programming languages like Rust which are designed for modern hardware architectures, and the like. I think of the Research work as Mozilla&#8217;s equivalent of a computer science department, albeit one that gets to ship code to hundreds of millions of users.

There are some projects which start out in Research and move to Labs, and there may be projects that are dreamt up in Labs and become Research topics &#8212; that&#8217;s just fine, and not a problem in my book, quite the opposite.

### The fuzzy boundary between Labs and New Feature work

In past years, Labs has been a place and a channel where creative folks have been able to take ideas about &#8220;what Firefox could be.&#8221;  In this model, people create add-ons or webapps that make a (hopefully crisp) point, and get feedback from a wide variety of audiences.  These are intended as trial balloons, and as with all balloons, they come down after a while.  When they work well, we get feedback quickly, and we can iterate on the &#8220;point&#8221; many times.  I think there have been several examples of this process at work, with my favorite being Ed Lee&#8217;s Prospector series of add-ons.  I do think we could do better at articulating motivations, identifying desired kinds of participation, and what kinds of lessons we&#8217;re learning from these efforts.
